aerodynamics of a\\nwing in a slipstream .\\n  an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was\\nmade in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift\\nincrease due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing\\nand at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the\\nresults were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different\\ntheoretical treatments of this problem .\\n  the comparative span loading curves, together with\\nsupporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment\\nproduced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or\\nboundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining lift\\nincrement, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree\\nwell with a potential flow theory .\\n  an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for\\nthe specific configuration of the experiment .\\n.I 2\\n.T\\nsimple shear flow past a flat plate in an

in an incompressible fluid of small\\nviscosity .\\nin the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it\\nis usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the\\nnose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an\\ninviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary\\nlayer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the\\nhypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat\\ndifferent from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's\\noriginal problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is\\nirrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid\\nfree stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of\\nvorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the\\npresent paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small\\nviscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again\\nbe treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature\\nbeing that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion\\nhere is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow .\\n.I 3\\n.T\\nthe boundary layer in simple shear flow past a flat plate .\\n.A\\nm. b. glauert\\n.B\\ndepartment of mathematics, university of manchester,

 experiments were performed in the 12-in. supersonic wind\\ntunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california\\ninstitute of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensional\\nroughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on a\\ntained at local mach numbers of 1.90, 2.71, and 3.67 by varying\\ntrip size, position, spacing, and reynolds number per inch .\\nthe results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent\\nflow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements begins\\nwhen the double row of spiral vortices trailing each element\\ncontaminates and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2)\\ntransition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent with\\nincreasing roughness height relative to the boundary-layer\\nthickness, (3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strength\\nof the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the\\nensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements has\\nlittle effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of the\\nlaminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number where u\\nand v are the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of\\nthe boundary layer and k is roughness height, such that transition\\noccurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynolds\\nnumber to the one-fourth power, viz., where

an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated\\nflat plate, 5 by 26 in., was made in the galcit 5 by 5 in.\\nhypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal mach number of 5.8 .\\n  the phosphorescent lacquer technique was used for transition\\ndetection and was found to be in good agreement with total-head\\nrake measurements along the plate surface and pitot boundary-\\nlayer surveys .  it was found that the boundary layer was\\nlaminar at reynolds numbers of at least 5 x 10 .  transverse\\ncontamination caused by the turbulent boundary layer on the\\ntunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading\\nedge at reynolds numbers of 1.5 to 2 x 10, and spread at a\\nuniform angle of 5 compared to 9 degree in low-speed flow .\\n  the effect of two-dimensional and local disturbances was\\ninvestigated .  the technique of air injection into the boundary\\nlayer as a means of hastening transition was extensively used .\\nalthough the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers\\nas low as 10, a fully developed turbulent boundary layer was\\nnot obtained at reynolds numbers much below 2 x 10\\nregardless of the amount of air injected .\\n  a qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis\\non the possibility of a greater stability of the laminar boundary\\nlayer in hypersonic flow than at lower speeds .\\n  direct skin-friction measurements were made by means of the\\nfloating element technique, over a range of reynolds numbers\\nverified as being laminar over the complete range .  with air\\ninjection, turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds\\nnumbers greater than 2 x 10, this value being in good agreement with\\nearlier results of this investigation .  the turbulent skin-friction\\ncoefficient was found to be approximately 0.40 of that for\\nincompressible flow for a constant value of r, and 0.46 for an effective\\nreynolds number between 5 and 6 x 10 .\\n.I

.\\n  it will be shown that the differential equations for a heated\\nplate with large temperature gradient and for a similar plate at\\nconstant temperature can be made the same by a proper\\nmodification of the thickness and the loading for the isothermal plate .\\nthis fact leads to the result that the stresses in the heated plate\\ncan be calculated from measured strains on the unheated plate by\\na series of relations, called the /similarity laws ./  the\\napplication of this analog theory to solid wings under aerodynamic\\nheating is discussed in detail .  the loading on the unheated analog\\nwing is, however, complicated and involves the novel concept\\nof feedback and /body force/ loading .  the problem of stressing\\na heated box-wing structure can be solved by the same analog\\nmethod and is briefly discussed .\\n.I 14\\n.T\\npiston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the\\naeroelastician .\\n.A\\nashley,h. and zartarian,g.\\n.B\\nj. ae. scs. 23, 1956, 1109.\\n.W\\npiston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the\\naeroelastician .\\n  representative applications are described which illustrate the\\nextent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed\\nunsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of\\ncertain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston\\ntheory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by\\nhayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings\\nhas been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing\\nexpansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the\\nflight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and\\nare negligible, the theory predicts a point-function\\nrelationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the\\nnormal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's\\nmotion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic\\nequations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always\\nreduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .\\n  essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-\\ntorsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section\\nairfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of\\nmore exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .\\nmoreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence\\nof thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that\\nwould be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic\\ntools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on\\nthree-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially\\nreduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by\\nwhich improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the\\nsuccessive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .\\n  other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are\\nreviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic\\naircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,\\nbut for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification\\nof ackeret's formulas .\\n  suggestions are made regarding future research based on the\\nnew aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where\\ncomputational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of\\nprecision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where\\nthermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions\\nmay be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical\\nway of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-\\nthermoelastic interaction problems .\\n.I 15\\n.T\\non two-dimensional panel flutter .\\n.A\\nfung,y.c.\\n.B\\nj. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 145.\\n.W\\non two-dimensional

across the plate\\nraises the critical value of the /reduced velocity ./\\n  the applicability of the galerkin method to the linearized\\nproblem of flutter of an unbuckled plate has been questioned by\\nseveral authors .  in this paper the flutter condition was\\nformulated in the form of an integral equation and solved numerically\\nby the method of iteration and the method of

in\\naxisymmetric, compressible wakes .  because of the lack of applicable\\nexperimental data, it was found necessary to make such an estimate by\\nrationally extending the few available data for

transfer\\ninto one side of a flat plate, representing a thick skin, and the\\neffect of the resulting temperature distribution in inducing\\nthermal stresses associated with bending restraint at the plate edges .\\nnumerical results are presented for the transient temperature\\ndifferentials in the plate when the environment temperature first\\nincreases linearly with time and then remains constant, the\\nperiod of linear increase representing the time of acceleration of\\nthe aircraft .  corresponding thermal stress information is\\npresented .\\n  the second case is that of the wide-flanged i-beam with\\nconvective heat transfer into the outer faces of the flanges .  numerical\\nresults are presented for transient temperature differentials for a\\nwide range of values of the applicable parameters and for an\\nenvironment temperature variation as described above .\\ncorresponding thermal stresses in a beam of infinite length are\\ndetermined .  a theoretical analysis of the stress distribution in a beam\\nof finite length is carried out and numerical results obtained for\\none case .  an experimental investigation of temperatures and\\nstresses in such a beam is

chief emphasis is placed on the case of the laminar boundary layer .\\n  part 1 of the present report deals with the general mathematical\\ntheory .  the general equations governing one normal mode of

the temperature disturbances\\nhave only a negligible effect on those particular velocity solutions\\nwhich depend primarily on the viscosity coefficient (/viscous\\nsolutions/) .  indeed, the latter are actually of the same form in the\\ncompressible fluid as in the incompressible fluid, at least to the first\\napproximation .  because of this fact, the mathematical analysis is\\ngreatly simplified .  the final equation determining the characteristic\\nvalues of the stability problem depends on the /inviscid solutions/ and\\nthe function of tietjens in a manner very similar to the

energy from the main flow if the gradient\\nof the product of mean density and mean vorticity near the solid surface\\nhas a sign opposite to that near the outer edge of the boundary layer .\\n  a general stability criterion has been obtained in terms of the\\ngradient of the product of density and vorticity, analogous to the\\nrayleigh-tollmien criterion for the case of an incompressible fluid

was made in the langley 4 by 4-foot supersonic\\npressure tunnel at mach numbers of 1.61 and 2.01 to determine (1) the\\neffect of distributed roughness on boundary-layer transition with the\\nmodel surface at adiabatic wall temperature and cooled and (2) the\\neffect of surface cooling on the lateral spread of turbulence .  both\\ndistributed granular-type and single spherical roughness particles were\\nused, and transition of the boundary layer was determined by hot-wire\\nanemometers .  the transition-triggering mechanism of the\\nthree-dimensional roughness at supersonic speeds appeared to be the same as\\nthat previously observed at subsonic speeds .  in fact, the critical\\nvalue of the roughness reynolds number parameter (that is,\\nthe value at which turbulent spots are initiated by the roughness) was\\nfound to be approximately the same at supersonic and subsonic speeds\\nwhen complete local conditions at the top of the roughness, including\\ndensity and viscosity, were considered in the formulation of the\\nroughness reynolds number .  for three-dimensional roughness at a reynolds\\nnumber less than its critical value, the roughness introduced no\\ndisturbances of sufficient magnitude to influence transition .  surface\\ncooling, although providing a theoretical increase in stability to small\\ndisturbances, did not increase to any important extent the value of the\\ncritical roughness reynolds number for three-dimensional roughness\\nparticles .  cooling, therefore, because of its effect on the\\nboundary-layer thickness, density, and viscosity actually promoted transition due\\nto existing three-dimensional surface roughness for given mach and\\nreynolds numbers .  the measured lateral spread of turbulence in the\\nboundary layer appeared to be unaffected by the increased laminar\\nstability derived from the surface cooling .\\n.I 81\\n.T\\ncompressible laminar flow and heat transfer about a\\nrotating isothermal disk .\\n.A\\nostrach,s. and

the\\nemployment of thin, or light-weight, glass shields .\\n  investigation of these hypothetical glass shields leads to the\\nconclusion that a low thermal conductivity and a high specific heat,\\nand thus, a small thermal diffusivity are most desirable .  a small\\nthermal diffusivity yields high surface temperatures, causing a high\\nradiative heat transfer out of the shield,. and

the trail is\\ndivided into two regions ..  (1) the expansion-controlled trail,\\nwhich treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up to a\\npoint, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays to\\nthe free-stream value and

fundamentals of the statistical theory of turbulence .\\n.A\\nth. von karman\\n.B\\ncalifornia institute of technology\\n.W\\nthe fundamentals of the statistical theory of turbulence .\\nstatistical theory in general considers mean values of certain\\nquantities .  in the case of the turbulent motion one is interested in mean\\nvalues of velocities and of their derivatives, and in mean values of\\nsquares and products of velocities and their derivatives .  it was o.\\nreynolds who first expressed the so-called apparent or turbulent\\nstresses by the mean values of the products of the velocity components .  the\\ndifferent theories suggested so far have as their common objective the\\nestablishment of relations between certain mean values, e.g. between the\\nturbulent shear stresses given by the mean products of velocity\\nfluctuations and the derivatives of the mean velocities, i.e. the measured mean\\nvelocity gradients .  in this sort of investigations the conception of\\nthe /correlation/ is of paramount importance .  the late a. friedman\\ntried to introduce the correlations as unknown variables in the\\nhydrodynamic equations., however, he could not carry his investigations to\\npractical results, i.e., to results which can be compared with the\\nexperimental evidence .  recently, g. i. taylor had success in his\\nanalysis of /isotropic/ turbulence by means of correlation calculations, and\\nwas able to discuss, theoretically, the problem of the decay of\\nturbulence in a windstream behind a turbulence producing device .  his theory\\nraised considerable interest because it is concerned with the important\\nproblem of wind-tunnel turbulence and its results could be compared\\ndirectly with experimental work done by dryden in this country and by\\nfage, townend and simmons in england .\\nthe present paper is concerned with two fundamental problems.. with\\nuniform isotropic turbulence and with the turbulent friction in a\\nparallel stream .  first, the general theory of isotropic turbulence is\\ndeveloped .  this general theory includes taylor's consideration as a\\nspecial case .  however, it\\n.I 100\\n.T\\nvibration isolation

almost\\nalways be traced to vibratory forces originating\\nfrom the power plant .  these forces are transmitted\\nto the aircraft in two ways ..  (1) by the action of air\\nforces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent\\nto, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct\\ntransmission of unbalanced forces from the power\\nplant through the engine mounting .  the latter has\\nalways caused the preponderance of disturbance .\\nvibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting\\nstructure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the\\nassociated parts, and always shorten the useful life\\nof the entire aircraft structure .  more important,\\nhowever, are the psychological and physiological\\neffects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise\\non the passengers and crew .  this may very likely\\nbe the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so\\nintimately associated with flying .  the importance\\nand desirability of drastically reducing vibration can\\nhardly be questioned .\\n  this paper is limited to a consideration of the\\ndirectly transmitted forces and, further, considers the\\npower plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible means\\nto the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid body\\nof relatively large mass .  it is also limited to the case\\nof engines and engine supporting structures having\\naxial symmetry (radial engines), although the methods\\nemployed could easily be extended to other cases .\\n.I 101\\n.T\\nlaminar heat transfer over blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight\\nspeeds .\\n.A\\nlester lees\\n.B\\nthe ramo-wooldridge corporation, los angles, and california institute\\nof technology, pasadena, california\\n.W\\nlaminar heat transfer over blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight\\nspeeds .\\nthis paper deals with two limiting cases of laminar heat transfer over\\nblunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight speeds, or high stagnation\\ntemperatures..  (a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemical\\nreaction rates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusion\\nacross streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which the\\nvolume recombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/\\ncompared to diffusion across streamlines .  in either case the gas density\\nnear the surface of a blunt-nosed body is much higher than the density\\njust outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnation\\nenthalpy profiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in the\\nmore familiar case of moderate temperature differences .  in fact, in\\ncase (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface is\\nrepresented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradient\\nvalue, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtained\\ndirectly in terms of the surface pressure distribution .  in order to\\nillustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special cases\\nof an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped by a\\nspherical segment .\\nin the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling the\\ndiffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as the\\nlow-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replaced\\nby the schmidt number .  the simplifications introduced in case (a) are\\nalso applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rate\\nis similar., the maximum value of the ratio between the rate of heat\\ntransfer by diffusion alone and by heat conduction alone in the case of\\nthermodynamic equilibrium is given by..

most\\neffective when compared on a mass flow basis .  there is a marked\\neffect of mach number on the reduction of average skin friction,.\\nthis effect is not shown by the available theories .  limited\\ntransition location measurements indicate that the boundary layer\\ndoes not fully trip with gas injection but that the transition point\\napproaches a forward limit with increasing

of\\nmotion by an order-of-magnitude analysis .  these equations are\\nsolved for flow over a particular surface with zero surface pressure\\ngradient .  in this analysis, the pressure gradient normal to the\\nsurface is included, and the outer boundary conditions are\\nmodified in accordance with the requirements of flow over a curved\\nsurface .\\n  the results indicate that for equal reynolds numbers, the\\nstress on convex surfaces is less than the flat-plate value, while\\nthe stress on concave surfaces is greater than for a flat plate .  the\\nmost important effect of surface curvature, for the cases\\nconsidered, is the modification of the shape of the velocity profile\\nnear the /outer edge/ of the boundary layer .  the requirement\\nthat a smooth transition exist between the viscous flow and the\\npotential flow at the outer edge of the layer causes the profile to\\nhave a negative slope near the outer edge for convex surface\\ncurvature and a positive slope for concave

irrotational leads to the requirement that is zero at the outer edge\\nof the boundary layer .  in this theory any interaction between the two\\nregimes is accountable by a simple correction to the

stokes\\nand oseen .  since the perturbation theory arising from the\\nconsideration of small non-zero reynolds numbers is a singular\\none, the problem is largely that of devising suitable techniques for\\ntaking this singularity into account when expanding the solution\\nfor small reynolds numbers .\\n  the technique adopted is as follows .  separate, locally valid\\nthe regions close to, and far from, the obstacle .  reasons are\\npresented for believing that these 'stokes' and 'oseen' expansions\\nare, respectively, of the forms\\nwhere are spherical or cylindrical polar coordinates made\\ndimensionless with the radius of the obstacle, r is the reynolds\\nnumber, and and vanish with r .  substitution\\nof these expansions in the navier-stokes equation then yields a\\nset of differential equations for the coefficients and, but\\nonly one set of physical boundary conditions is applicable to each\\nexpansion (the no-slip conditions for the stokes expansion, and\\nthe uniform-stream condition for the oseen expansion) so that\\nunique solutions cannot be derived immediately .  however, the\\nfact that the two expansions are (in principle) both derived from\\nthe same exact solution leads to a 'matching' procedure which\\nyields further boundary conditions for each expansion .  it is thus\\npossible to determine alternately successive terms in each\\nexpansion .\\n  the leading terms of the expansions are shown to be closely\\nrelated to the original solutions of stokes and oseen, and detailed\\nresults for some further terms are obtained .\\n.I

an\\ninfinite expanse of compressible fluid is in\\nturbulent motion .  this motion generates noise\\nand radiates it into the surrounding fluid .\\nthe acoustic properties of the system are studied\\nin the special case in which the turbulent\\nregion consists of decaying isotropic turbulence .\\nit is assumed that the reynolds number\\nof the turbulence is large, and that the mach number is small .\\n  the noise appears to be generated mainly\\nby those eddies of the turbulence whose\\ncontribution to the rate of dissipation of kinetic\\nenergy by viscosity is negligible .\\n  it is shown that the intensity of sound at large\\ndistances from the turbulence is the same\\nas that due to a volume distribution of simple acoustic\\nsources occupying the turbulent region .\\nin this analogy, the whole fluid is to be regarded\\nas a stationary and uniform acoustic\\nmedium .  the local value of the acoustic power output\\np per mass of turbulent fluid is given\\napproximately by the formula\\nwhere a is a numerical constant, u is the\\nmean-square velocity fluctuation, is the time, and\\nc is the velocity of sound in the fluid .  the\\nconstant a is expressed in terms of the well-known\\nvelocity correlation function f(r) by\\nassuming the joint probability distribution of the\\nturbulent velocities and their first two\\ntime-derivatives at two points in space to be\\ngaussian .  the numerical value is\\nthen obtained by substituting the form of f(r)\\ncorresponding to heisenberg's theoretical\\nspectrum of isotropic turbulence .\\n  it is found that the effects of decay make\\nonly a small contribution to the value of a, and\\nthat the order of magnitude of a is not changed\\nwhen widely differing forms of the function\\nf(r) are used .\\n.I

classical hydrodynamics a steady\\nstream of frictionless incompressible fluid exercises no resultant\\nforce upon an obstacle, such as a rigid sphere, immersed in it .  the\\ndevelopment of a /resistance/ is usually attributed to viscosity, or\\nwhen there is a sharp edge to the negative pressure which may accompany\\nit (helmholtz) .  in either case it would seem that resistance involves\\nsomething of the nature of a wake, extending behind the obstacle to an\\ninfinite distance .  when the system of disturbed velocities, although\\nit may mathematically extend to infinity, remains as it were attached to\\nthe obstacle, there can be no resistance .\\nthe absence of resistance is asserted for an incompressible fluid., but\\nit can hardly be supposed that a small degree of compressibility, as in\\nwater, would affect the conclusion .  on the other hand, high relative\\nvelocities, exceeding that of sound in the fluid, must entirely alter\\nthe conditions .  it seems worth while to examine this question more\\nclosely, especially as the first effects of compressibility are amenable\\nto mathematical treatment .\\n.I 153\\n.T\\non the steady motion of viscous,

resistance .\\n  the general character of experimental\\nresults dealing with the effect of\\nshallow water on ship resistance may be\\nstated briefly as follows ..--at low\\nvelocities the resistance in shallow\\nwater is greater than in deep water, the\\nspeed at which the excess is first\\nappreciable varying with the type of vessel .\\nas the speed increases, the excess\\nresistance increases up to a maximum at a\\ncertain critical velocity, and then\\ndiminishes .  with still further increase of\\nspeed, the resistance in shallow\\nwater ultimately becomes, and remains, less\\nthan that in deep water at the same speed .\\nthe maximum effect is the more\\npronounced the shallower the water .\\nfor further details and references one\\nmay refer to standard treatises, but one\\nquotation may be made in regard to\\nthe critical velocity ..  /this maximum\\nappears to be at about a speed such\\nthat a trochoidal wave travelling at this\\nspeed in water of the same depth is\\nabout times as long as the vessel .\\nit was at one time supposed\\nthat the speed for maximum increase\\nin resistance was that of the wave of\\ntranslation .  this, however, holds only\\nfor water whose depth is less than\\nfor greater depths the speed of the\\nwave of translation rapidly becomes\\ngreater than the speed of maximum\\nincrease of resistance ./  in a recent\\nanalysis of the data, h. m. weitbrecht\\nexpresses a similar conclusion by stating\\nthat for each depth of water there is\\na critical velocity, but that the critical\\nvelocity does not vary as the

attention in the literature, considerably less\\ninformation can be found on the design and installation\\nof turbojet exit nozzles .  this condition should not be\\ninterpreted to indicate a lack of

the\\ndifficulties largely stem from the fact that the goals of\\nhigh jet thrust and low afterbody drag are not always\\ncompatible .  in many of the compromise solutions, it\\nis generally unsatisfactory to examine isolated nozzle\\nand afterbody performance .  rather they must be\\ntreated as a unit, and the complex effects of jet\\ninteraction with the external stream must be taken into\\naccount .  to accomplish this, the nozzle and air-frame\\ndesigners must closely coordinate their efforts .\\n  some of the aerodynamic problems of nozzle\\nafterbody combinations are outlined in this report .\\nparticular attention is devoted to the influence of the\\njet-stream interaction on both nozzle thrust and\\nafter-body drag .  for this purpose, use is made of shock-\\nboundary-layer-interaction concepts .  this approach,\\nalthough not precise, correctly predicts many trends\\nand is generally enlightening .\\n.I 173\\n.T\\nthe effect of a central jet on

of\\nspecific heats greatly different from air .  the present report is based\\non the idea that by properly mixing a heavy monatomic gas with a\\nsuitable heavy polyatomic gas, it is possible to obtain a heavy gas\\nmixture which has the correct ratio of specific heats and which is\\nnontoxic, nonflammable, thermally stable, chemically inert, and\\ncomprised of commercially available components .\\ncalculations were made of wind-tunnel characteristics for 63 gas pairs\\ncomprising 21 different polyatomic gases properly mixed with each of\\nthree monatomic gases (argon, krypton, and xenon) .  for a given\\nmach number, reynolds number, and tunnel pressure, a gas-mixture\\nwind tunnel having the same specific-heat ratio as air would be\\nappreciably smaller and would require much less power than a\\ncorresponding air wind tunnel .  analogous though different advantages\\ncan be realized in compressor research and in firing-range research .\\nthe most significant applications, perhaps, arise through selecting and\\nproportioning a gas mixture so as to have at ordinary wind-tunnel\\ntemperatures certain dimensionless characteristics which air at\\nflight temperatures possesses but which air at ordinary wind-tunnel\\ntemperatures does not possess .  characteristics which involve the\\nrelaxation time (or bulk viscosity), the variation of viscosity with\\ntemperature, and the variation of specific heat with temperature fall\\nwithin this category .  other applications arise in heat-transfer\\nresearch since certain gas mixtures can be concocted

in the direct meaning that\\ndistributions in the boundary layer keep the similar form lengthwise .\\ncalculations are accomplished for the region of strong interaction\\nbetween the boundary layer and the shock wave .  from several calculations\\nit may be expected that if the thickness of the body becomes small, the\\nthickness of the layer in which the longitudinal velocity component u is\\nrapidly decreased also becomes small, and in the major part of the\\nboundary layer, only the normal component v is increased .  further if\\nthe thickness of the body is increased, then, the height of the shock\\nwave, the pressure on the wall, and the shear stress at the wall are\\nalso increased while the boundary layer thickness is decreased .  the\\nnose region is excluded by the reason that the ordinary boundary layer\\ntheory will be invalid there .\\n.I 193\\n.T\\na study of inviscid flow about air foils at high supersonic\\nspeeds .\\n.A\\neggers, a.j., syvertson, c.a.,

analyticially . with the assumption that air behaves\\nas a diatomic gas, it is found the the shock-expansion\\nmethod may be used to predict the flow about curved airfoils up to\\nextremely high mach numbers, provided the flow deflection\\nangles are not too close to those corresponding to shock\\ndetachment . this result applies not only to the determination of the\\nsurface pressure distribution, but also to the determination of the\\nwhole flow field about an airfoil . verification of this observation\\nis obtained with the aid of the method of characteristics by\\nextensive calculations of the pressure gradient and shock-wave\\ncurvature at the leading edge, and by calculations of the pressure\\ndistribution on a 10-percent-thick biconvex airfoil at 0 angle of\\nattack .\\nan approximation to the shock-expansion method for thin\\nairfoils at high mach numbers is also investigated and is found\\nto yield pressures in error by less than 10 percent at mach\\nnumbers above three and flow deflection angles up to 25 . this\\nslender-airfoil method is relatively simple in form and thus may\\nprove useful for some engineering purposes .\\neffects of caloric imperfections of air manifest in disturbed\\nflow fields at  high mach numbers are investigated, particular\\nattention being given to the reduction of the ratio of specific\\nheats . so long as this ratio does not decrease appreciably below\\nto include the effects of these imperfections, should be substantially\\nas accurate as for ideal-gas flows . this observation is\\nverfied with the aid of a generalized shock-expansion method and a\\ngeneralized method of characteristics employed in forms applicable\\nfor local air temperatures up to about 5000 rankine .\\nthe slender-airfoil method is modified to employ an average\\nvalue of the ratio of specific heats for a particular flow field .\\nthis simplified method has essentially the same accuracy for\\nimperfect-gas flows as its counterpart has for ideal-gas flows .\\nan approximate flow analysis is made at extremely high mach\\nnumbers where it is indicated that the ratio of specific heats may\\napproach close to 1 . in this case, it is found that the\\nshock-expansion method may be in considerable error,. however, the\\nbusemann method for the limit of infinite free-stream mach\\nnumber and specific-heat ratio of 1

in yaw\\ndevelops a side force like that of a fin .  in 1917, r. g. harris\\nexpressed this force in terms of the torque coefficient for the\\nunyawed propeller .  of several attempts to express the side\\nforce directly in terms of the shape of the blades, however, none\\nhas been completely satisfactory .  an analysis that\\nincorporates induction effects not adequately covered in previous work\\nand that gives good agreement with experiment over a wide\\nrange of operating conditions is presented herein .  the present\\nanalysis shows that the fin analogy may be extended to the form\\nof the side-force expression and that the effective fin area may\\nbe taken as the projected side area of the propeller .  the\\neffective aspect ratio is of the order of 8 and the appropriate dynamic\\npressure is roughly that at the propeller disk as augmented by\\nthe inflow .  the variation of the inflow velocity, for a\\nfixed-pitch propeller, accounts for most of the variation of side force\\nwith advance-diameter ratio v nd .\\n  the propeller forces due to an angular velocity of pitch are\\nalso analyzed and are shown to be very small for the pitching\\nvelocities that may actually be realized in maneuvers, with the\\nexception of the spin .\\n  further conclusions are ..  a dual-rotating propeller in yaw\\ndevelops up to one-third more side force than a single-rotating\\npropeller .  a yawed single-rotating propeller experiences a\\npitching moment in addition to the side force .  the pitching\\nmoment is of the order of the moment produced by a force equal\\nto the side force, acting at the end of a lever arm equal to the\\npropeller radius .  this cross-coupling between pitch and yaw\\nis small but possibly not negligible .\\n  the formulas for propellers in yaw derived herein (with the\\nexception of the compressibility correction) and a series of\\ncharts of the side-force derivative calculated therefrom have been\\npresented without

is required from a turbine in a single stage\\nit is necessary to use high pressure ratios across the\\nnozzle blades, thus producing supersonic velocities at\\ninlet to the rotor .  as part of an investigation into such\\nturbines, several designs for the inter-blade passages of\\nthe rotor have been tested in a two-dimensional tunnel,\\na design theory being developed concurrently .\\n  the first design, featuring constant passage width\\nand curvature as in steam-turbine practice, but having\\nthin leading and trailing edges, was found to suffer from\\nfocusing of the compression waves from the concave\\nsurface, with consequent flow separation from the\\nopposite convex surface .  it gave a velocity coefficient of\\nmeasured at an inlet mach number of 1.90 and turning\\nangle of 140 deg .  the measured value compares favourably\\nwith values from previous steam tests, where the\\nresults have been in the range from 0.65 to 0.92 .\\n  from theoretical reasoning, and from additional test\\nobservations, a subsequent passage was designed\\nhaving an inlet transition length of small curvature, leading\\nto a free-vortex passage of double the transition\\ncurvature,. a small amount of contraction was incorporated .\\nschlieren photographs showed the flow in this\\npassage to be almost shock free .  a thin region of low-energy\\nair existed close to the convex surface, but\\nliquid-injection tests located only one small bubble of reversed flow .\\npressure traverses at exit indicated a velocity\\ncoefficient of 0.952, based on the area-mean total pressure .\\nwhen allowance is made for turning angle and\\nreynolds number this result appears to compare quite favourably\\nwith previous work .\\n  it would seem that the optimum blade pitching in a turbine\\nwould be about 20 to 30 per cent closer than in a\\ntwo-dimensional cascade .  however, the resultant pitching\\ntends to become very close, except at very large\\nturning angles, with the result that in some applications\\ndifficulties could arise in the practical design and\\nmanufacture .\\n  several uncertainties remain and the present design must be regarded\\nas still experimental

investigation, which has been\\nreported in naca acr l5d20, was the development of efficient\\nsupersonic diffusers to decelerate air through the speed of sound .\\nthe present report is largely a general discussion of some of the\\nessential aerodynamics of single-stage supersonic axial-flow\\ncompressors .  in the supersonic flow about isolated bodies,\\nlarge energy losses usually occur due to wave systems which\\nextend far from the bodies .  supersonic flow entering a cascade\\nis considered and, in this case, the possibility of entirely\\neliminating this extended wave system is demonstrated,. thus, no\\nreason for supersonic compressors to be necessarily inefficient\\nis apparent .  the conditions that occur as the flow through the\\ncompressor is being started are discussed and a hypothesis as\\nto the type of transonic flow which will be encountered is\\nproposed .\\n  as an approach to the study of supersonic compressors, three\\npossible velocity diagrams are discussed briefly .  because of\\nthe encouraging results of this study, an experimental\\nsingle-stage supersonic compressor has been constructed and tested in\\nfreon-12 .  in this compressor, air

(1)\\nnear the nozzle (distances less than 4 or 5 jet diam downstream\\nof the nozzle) the intensity of turbulence, expressed as percent\\nof core velocity, is a maximum at a distance of approximately\\nincreasing mach and or reynolds number .  at distances greater\\nthan 8 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle, however, the\\nmaximum intensity moves out and decreases in magnitude until\\nthe turbulence-intensity profiles are quite flat and approaching\\nsimilarity .

(3) farther downstream of the\\njet the longitudinal scale reaches a maximum and then decreases\\napproximately linearly with distance .  (4) near the nozzle the\\nlateral scale is much smaller than the longitudinal and does not\\nvary with distance from the centerline, while the longitudinal\\nscale is a maximum at a distance from the centerline of about\\nmum moves out from the centerline .

.\\n  the apparatus has been used to determine\\ntransition and laminar separation points on model\\nwings in a number of the national physical\\nlaboratory tunnels .  smoke filaments have been\\nmaintained in the laminar state up to wind\\nspeeds of 180 ft. sec. in the new tunnels .\\n  there is much to be said for making a standard\\npractice of visualising boundary layer flow

concentrated form .  the motion\\nand pressure of the surrounding air is\\ncalculated .  it is found that a spherical shock\\nwave is propagated outwards whose\\nradius r is related to the time t since the explosion\\nstarted by the equation\\nwhere is the atmospheric density, e is\\nthe energy released and s a calculated\\nfunction of, the ratio of the specific heats of air .\\n  the effect of the explosion is to force most\\nof the air within the shock front into a\\nthin shell just inside that front .  as the front\\nexpands, the maximum pressure\\ndecreases till, at about 10 atm., the analysis ceases\\nto be accurate .  at 20 atm. 45 of\\nthe energy has been degraded into heat which is\\nnot available for doing work and used\\nup in expanding against atmospheric pressure .\\nthis leads to the prediction that an\\natomic bomb would be only half as efficient, as\\na blast-producer, as a high explosive\\nreleasing the same amount of energy .\\n  in the ideal problem the maximum pressure is\\nproportional to r, and comparison\\nwith the measured pressures near high explosives,\\nin the range of radii where the two\\nmight be expected to be comparable, shows that\\nthese conclusions are borne out by\\nexperiment .\\n.I 263\\n.T\\ncylindrical shock waves produced by instantaneous energy\\nrelease .\\n.A\\nlin,s.c.\\n.B\\nj.app.phys. 25, 1954, 54.\\n.W\\ncylindrical

for\\nconducting boundary-layer transition experiments .  the use of the\\nshock tube permits the study of transition with highly cooled\\nboundary layers, as may be encountered on hypersonic vehicles .\\n  boundary-layer transition investigations have been made on\\noptically polished pyrex hemisphere-cylinder and ellipse-cylinder\\nmodels with stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratios between 4.5 and\\nroughness estimated to be less than 1 microinch (rms) .\\ntransition was detected by measurements of the heat-transfer rates on\\nthe model surface .\\n  the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristic\\nfeature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on a\\nhemisphere was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over the\\nentire supersonic portion of the hemisphere .  this implies that\\ntransition first occurred in the sonic region .  the transition\\nreynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer\\nedge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the\\nsonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation-\\nto-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .  transition\\noccurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylinder\\nmodel at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynolds\\nnumber, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation-\\nto-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .\\n  the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical\\nportion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided an\\nextension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooled\\nhemisphere-cone-cylinder model in a wind tunnel .  the transition\\nreynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of\\nthe same order of magnitude as the minimum transition\\nreynolds numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experiments .  the\\nresults indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layer\\ncooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies with\\na highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation-\\nto-wall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30 .  that is, the transition\\nreynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary-\\nlayer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred\\nat a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000\\nbased on local external properties and a distance along the body\\nsurface from the stagnation point) .\\n  the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared to\\nbe an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the\\nreynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in the\\ntransition reynolds number with increased boundary-layer\\ncooling .  that is, transition occurred at a lower reynolds\\nnumber on the ellipse-cylinder configuration than on the\\nhemisphere-cylinder .  also, the increase in transition reynolds number with\\nan increase in boundary-layer cooling was even less significant\\nfor the ellipse-cylinder than the hemisphere-cylinder .\\n.I 273\\n.T\\nflow past slender blunt bodies - a review and extension .\\n.A\\ncapiaux,r. and karchmar,l.\\n.B\\npaper 61-201-1904, nat. ias-ars joint meeting,

which was described in a previous paper, was\\nused to test a series of convergent-divergent turbine\\nnozzles .  the results of these tests, along with the test\\nof a convergent turbine nozzle, are compared with each\\nother and with analytical values .  two kinds of analytical\\nvalues are employed, namely, the usual values obtained\\nfrom an assumed isentropic expansion from inlet state to\\nexhaust pressure, and the values obtained from the\\nassumption that the processes in the nozzle are isentropic\\nexcept for a normal shock which takes up a position in the\\nnozzle such as to cause the stream to fill the exit area at\\nthe exhaust pressure whenever possible .  this latter kind\\nof analytical value involves no shock when the exit area can\\nbe filled at the exhaust pressure by means of isentropic\\nprocesses only, or when the exhaust pressure is lowered\\nso far that the shock has passed out of the passage .  the\\nagreement of the test results with the calculated results\\nof this latter kind is good, and the disagreement which\\nexists can be attributed largely to separation at the shock\\nand to transmission of exhaust-pressure effects upstream\\nthrough the boundary layer .\\n.I 277\\n.T\\nstudy of flow conditions and deflection angle at exit\\nof two-dimensional cascade of turbine rotor blades\\nat critical and supercritical

and\\nstatic-pressure surveys, and also are compared with an analysis of\\nschlieren photographs of the flow downstream of the blades .  a two-\\ndimensional cascade of six blades with an axial width of 1.80 inches\\nwas used for the static-pressure surveys and for some of the\\nschlieren photographs .  in order to determine the flow conditions several\\nblade chords downstream of the cascade,

considerably lower than that required to give critical\\nvelocity at the throat section, the flow was deflected in the tangential\\ndirection as predicted for the incompressible case .  as the pressure\\nratio was lowered further, the aerodynamic loading of the rear\\nportion of the blade reached a maximum value and remained constant .\\nafter this condition was attained, the expansion downstream of the\\ncascade took place with a constant tangential velocity so that no\\nfurther increase in the amount of turning across the blade row and\\nno further increase in the loading of the

transonic speeds\\nand methods for fixing transition in model experiments .\\n  the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic\\nspeeds arise from differences between the conditions\\nunder which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in\\nhow they behave after separation .  for turbulent\\nboundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly\\nas the reynolds number is changed and in many\\nexamples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent\\nlayers that occur naturally at high reynolds number\\nand for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed\\nartificially .  the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel\\ntests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be\\nminimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by\\nintroducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by\\nexcrescences attached to the surface .  the fact that the\\neffects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than\\nfor the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered\\nat full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever\\npossible .\\n  several methods which can be used to fix transition are described,\\nand the results obtained by using them are compared .\\nin general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement\\nis found, and explanations can be advanced for\\ncases in which discrepancies occur .  several uncertainties and\\ndifficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed\\nand illustrated by examples .  in particular, special care is needed\\nin interpreting the results obtained with transition\\nfixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10\\nbased on local chord for wings of about 0.1\\nthickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner\\nwings) .\\n  the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased\\nfor three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are\\nswept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds\\nnumber near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range\\nof incidence including high incidences for which the flow may\\nseparate from very close to the leading edge .  under\\nthese circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the\\nexcrescences at different chordwise positions for low and\\nhigh angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice .\\nmore research is needed before sound recommendations\\ncan be made as to how and where transition should be fixed\\non such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is\\noften not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully .\\n  in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples\\nare given of the spurious results that have been avoided\\nsuccessfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even\\nat low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition\\nmay not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead\\nof the shock, and of the conditions under which there\\nare some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition\\nhave been satisfactory .\\n.I 316\\n.T\\nthe occurrence

kemp,n.h.\\n.B\\nj. ae. scs. 27, 1960.\\n.W\\nvarious aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied\\ngas flow .\\n  this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous\\naerodynamic characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and\\nat sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free\\npath becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer\\ntheory but not so large that free molecule concepts apply .\\n  results of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to\\ndefine the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of\\ncontinuum theory .  based on theoretical and experimental\\nevidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a\\nmodel, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition .  this\\nmodel may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in\\ndetail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a\\nreasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities .\\n  in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes\\nof problems ..  a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/\\nclass, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction .\\nfor the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the\\nshock layer region between the shock and the body is fully\\nviscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer\\nare small at the shock wave boundary .  here, the use of the\\nnavier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given\\nby the hugoniot relations is justified .  for the merged layer\\nclass, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes\\nequations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock\\nstructure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary\\nconditions .  a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/\\nconditions where the shock may no longer be considered an\\ninfinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened\\nsufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis .  in this\\ncase we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying\\nconservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses,\\nand heat conduction .\\n  for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes\\nequations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for\\nboth the viscous and merged layer class of problems .  solutions\\nof these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow\\nproblems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to\\nillustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations\\nhave been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the\\nassumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful\\napproximation at hypersonic speeds .  to illustrate the merged\\nlayer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere\\nusing the incipient merged layer approximation .\\n  results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear,\\nand heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled\\nsphere flying at hypersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds\\nnumber, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above\\nthe extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer\\nregime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime .\\nas the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged\\nregime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static\\nand stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease .\\n  calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with\\ndecreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime,\\nthe density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy\\nbehind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they\\nare higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the\\nstagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy .\\n  for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the\\nsame quantities are presented as for the sphere .  the increase\\nfound in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated\\nboundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction\\ntheory .\\n  a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental\\ndata for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and\\nthe behavior predicted by the results of the present calculations .\\nqualitative agreement is indicated

importance of the leading-edge region at\\nhypersonic speeds, the influence of the leading-edge shock wave on\\nthe laminar boundary layer is investigated in two simple cases of\\nsteady flow over a semi-infinite, insulated flat plate..  (1) sharp\\nleading edge., (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated by a normal\\nshock wave .  the streamlines that enter the boundary layer over a large\\nregion of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wave\\nvery near the leading-edge, where the shock is strong and highly\\ncurved .  consequently, the temperature at the outer edge of the\\nboundary layer is appreciably higher than free-stream temperature,\\nand the vorticity there is not zero .  the effects of this shock-wave\\nlarger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundary-layer theory,\\nand an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within the\\nframework of that theory .  the numerical magnitude of the shock-wave\\ninfluence is found to be appreciable .  for the case of the blunt\\nleading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted against\\nthe hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimental\\ndata of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of this\\nparameter .  these approximate results show that the influence of the\\nleading-edge region at hypersonic speeds requires careful theoretical\\nand experimental study .\\n.I 335\\n.T\\nthe

boundary\\nlayer .\\n  a theory is developed which describes the effect of a general\\ndiffusion field on the dynamic and thermal characteristics of a\\nlaminar boundary layer on a flat plate in steady compressible\\nflow .  fluid properties are considered as functions of\\ntemperature and local concentration of the foreign gas .  the diffusion\\nfield is described by a differential equation that relates\\nconvective and diffusion transfer and which considers diffusion currents\\narising from gradients of concentration and temperature .  by\\nmeans of the usual transformations the system is reduced to a set\\nof ordinary differential equations, which in turn are transformed\\ninto a set of integral equations .  the latter is amenable to\\nsolution by the method of successive approximations .\\n  the theory and results have bearing on the problem of control\\nand reduction of aerodynamic heating at hypersonic speeds .\\nthe special feature of this approach lies in the utilization of\\ndiffusion fields for the purpose of reducing the detrimental effects\\nof viscous dissipation .  although the theory is adapted to a\\nfuller investigation of this problem, the numerical examples\\nconsidered involve mainly diffusion fields of helium, with which\\ngood results have been achieved at mach numbers 8 and 12 .\\nwhereas at the higher mach number the influx of heat was\\npractically eliminated, a reversal in the direction of heat flow has\\nbeen effected at the lower mach number .\\n.I 343\\n.T\\ntranspiration cooling experiments in a turbulent

introduces his survey by a brief review of the history of\\ninvestigations dealing with boundary layers on impermeable solid\\nsurfaces, and notes that no true theory exists for turbulent\\nboundary layers, the success of studies in this area having been due to\\nthe introduction of artificial, if ingenious, assumptions which\\npermitted empirical correlations fd data .  the terminology introduced\\nby the author for distinguishing the different situations involving\\nmass transfer from the wall to the stream may give rise to some\\nobjections .  for instance, /film cooling/ need not refer only to\\nthe injection of a liquid, since applications involving gas film\\ncooling exist .  also, his restriction of the term /transpiration\\ncooling/ to refer to the injection through a porous surface of a gas\\nonly of the same composition as the exterior stream does not enjoy\\nuniversal usage .  the influence of mass transfer on heat transfer\\nthrough laminar boundary layers and on the transition from laminar\\nto turbulent flow is described, with consideration given to the\\nquestion of the net effect of the stabilizing influence of surface\\ncooling and the destabilizing influence of injection .\\n  reviewer suggests that author's inaccurate statement to the\\neffect that /thus far the higher energy conditions do not threaten\\nto involve turbulent injection, so turbulent boundary-layer research\\nenjoys a fairly academic serenity broken only by its own\\nfrustrations/ be excused on grounds of poetic license, although it\\nignores the efforts being devoted to the pressing practical problems\\nof erosive burning of solid propellants (possibly the most common\\nexample of a complete /aerothermochemical/ problem involving\\ndistributed surface heat and mass

experimental problems involved in research\\non boundary layers with blowing, and notes the desirability of\\nvelocity distribution measurements, especially in turbulent injection\\nlayers .  the observation that no good data on concentration\\nprofiles in the case of the diffusion boundary layer have been\\npublished may be an overstatement, since author's bibliography\\noverlooks the work of

method presents some special design\\nproblems .  in the former case, it is often possible to\\nresolve the motion into two planes and consider the\\npitch and yaw control systems as independent\\ntwo-dimensional problems .  this simplification is not\\npossible in the case of polar control and it is usually\\nnecessary to consider the whole three-dimensional\\nsystem .  the equations of motion which result are, in\\ngeneral, not susceptible to analysis .  because of this,\\nthe design of control systems requires extensive use of\\nsimulators .\\n.I 369\\n.T\\nan

supersonic blunt body\\nproblem for prescribed arbitrary axisymmetric shapes .\\n  the integral method of belotserkovskii has been carried out to\\nthe first approximation for arbitrary blunt axisymmetric bodies\\nin supersonic or hypersonic flight .  this method is direct, in\\nthat it gives the surface-pressure distribution and shock shape for\\na prescribed body .  results obtained by numerical integration\\nfor several body shapes at several mach numbers are compared\\nto experimental results with good agreement .  it is also shown\\nthat the method can be successfully applied to pointed bodies\\nwith attached shock .  in the stagnation region, simple\\nrelationships are found from the equations of the first approximation\\nwhich connect the surface-velocity gradient, shock curvature,\\nshock-detachment distance, and body curvature .  these\\nrelations are also correlated with experiment for a variety of shapes\\nas a function of mach number .  the correlations permit a rapid\\nestimate of the stagnation-point velocity gradient, important for\\nheat-transfer calculations, for any blunt body from the shock\\nstand-off distance .  a method for a higher approximation is\\ndescribed, for which, in contrast to the higher approximations of\\nbelotserkovskii, a large number of simultaneous total differential\\nequations with unknown parameters does not occur .  one form\\nof this method has been studied numerically .  results are given\\nwhich, though only partially successful, indicate the amount of\\nimprovement to be expected from a higher approximation

brooklyn, freeport, n.y.\\n.W\\ntheoretical pressure distribution on a hemisphere-cylinder\\ncombination .\\nin recent years great use has been made of approximate methods for\\nthe determination of the pressure distribution on blunt-nosed bodies\\nand afterbodies at high mach numbers .  for quasi-spherical bodies\\nit has been suggested that modified newtonian theory in combination\\nwith a prandtl-meyer expansion be used on the nose portion, the two\\nlaws being matched at the point where the pressure gradients are equal .\\nno simple approximation, however, has been found for flat-nosed bodies .\\nas for the pressure distribution on the afterbody, the blast-wave\\nanalogy has been suggested for general nose shapes but particular\\nafterbody profiles .\\nthe purpose of the present note is to compare these approximate\\nestimates with a more accurate determination of the flow field about\\na hemisphere-cylinder in an ideal gas flow .  it was felt that since\\nexperimental investigations in air at this mach number are scarce\\nand very difficult to obtain, the comparison would be of interest .  the\\nbasis of comparison is the flow field as it results from a numerical\\nintegration of the exact equations governing the motion of the ideal\\nfluid .\\n.I 371\\n.T\\nnote on tip-bluntness effects in the supersonic and\\nhypersonic regimes

on\\nflows at m = 6.85 around 10 half-angle cones with blunted\\ntips .  since the demarcation between the supersonic and\\nhypersonic regimes is not sharp and since one expects hypersonic flows\\nto be generally similar to those at lower mach numbers--\\nespecially where viscous effects do not predominate throughout the\\nentire field of interest--it is of some value to compare bertram's\\nresults with those obtained by giese and bergdolt for 15\\nhalf-angle cones at m = 2.45 .  following the observation by charters\\nand stein that drag coefficient measurements on blunted cones\\nimply a reynolds number effect, giese and bergdolt study the\\nconvergence to conical flow of the perturbed flow about a cone\\nwith truncated tip .  they employ the mach-zehnder\\ninterferometer and the conical flow criterion as analytical tools .\\n.I 372\\n.T\\nan experimental investigation of flow about simple\\nblunt bodies at a nominal mach number of 5.

generalized expansion method and its application\\nto bodies travelling at high supersonic airspeeds .\\n  it is demonstrated that the shock-expansion method can be\\ngeneralized to treat a large class of hypersonic flows, only one of\\nwhich is flow about airfoils .  this generalized method predicts\\nthe whole flow field, including shock-wave curvatures and\\nresulting vorticity, providing that (1) disturbances originating on\\nthe surface of an object are largely absorbed in shock waves with\\nwhich they interact and (2) disturbances associated with the\\ndivergence of stream lines in tangent planes to the surface are of\\nsecondary importance compared to those associated with the\\ncurvature of stream lines in planes normal to the surface .  it is\\nshown that these conditions may be met in three-dimensional as\\nwell as two-dimensional hypersonic flows .  when they are met,\\nsurface streamlines may be taken as geodesics, which, in turn,\\nmay be related to the geometry of the surface .\\n  the validity of the generalized shock-expansion method for\\nthree-dimensional hypersonic flows is checked by comparing\\npredictions of theory with experiment for the surface pressures and\\nbow shock waves of bodies of revolution .  the bodies treated\\nare two ogives having fineness ratios of 3 and 5 .  tests were\\nconducted at mach numbers from 2.7 to 6.3 and angles of attack up\\nto 15 degrees in the 10- by 14-in. supersonic wind tunnel of the\\names aeronautical laboratory .  at the lower angles of attack,\\ntheory and experiment approach agreement when the ratio of\\nmach number to fineness ratio--that is, the hypersonic\\nsimilarity parameter--exceeds 1 .  at the larger angles of attack, theory\\ntends to break down, as would be expected, on the leeward sides\\nof the bodies .\\n  as a final point, it is inquired if the two-dimensionality of\\ninviscid hypersonic flows has any counterpart in hypersonic\\nboundary-layer flows .  the question is answered in the\\naffirmative, and results of experiment are employed to provide a partial\\ncheck of this conclusion .\\n.I 374\\n.T\\nan investigation of optimum zoom climb techniques

1962.\\n.W\\ninviscid hypersonic airflows with coupled non-equilibrium\\nprocesses .\\n  analyses have been made of the effects of coupled chemical rate\\nprocesses in external inviscid hypersonic airflows at high enthalpy\\nlevels .  exact (numerical) solutions have been obtained by the\\ninverse method for inviscid airflow over a near-spherical nose\\nunder flight conditions where substantial nonequilibrium prevails\\nthrough the nose region .  typical conditions considered include\\nnose radii of the order of 1 ft at an altitude of 250,000 ft and\\nvelocities of 15,000 and 23,000 ft per sec .\\n  the results illustrate the general importance of the coupling\\namong the reactions considered .  these included\\ndissociation-recombination, bimolecular-exchange, and ionization reactions .\\nthe exact solutions show the bimolecular, no exchange reactions\\nto be important in blunt-nose flow for the kinetics of no and n,\\nas they are in the case of a plane shock wave .  an important\\ndifference between blunt-nose flow and plane shock flow,\\nhowever, is the gasdynamic expansion in the curved shock layer of the\\nformer .  this expansion reduces post-shock reaction rates .  as a\\nconsequence, in the regime studied the oxygen and nitrogen-atom\\nconcentrations tend to freeze in the nose region at levels below\\nthose for infinite-rate equilibrium .  the reduction below the\\nequilibrium dissociation level can be large, particularly for\\nnitrogen dissociation at higher velocities .\\n  in the regime considered, the chemical kinetics are dominated\\nby two-body collision processes .  the inviscid nose flow,\\nincluding coupled nonequilibrium phenomena, is thus amenable to\\nbinary scaling for a given velocity .  the binary scaling is\\ndemonstrated for a range of altitude and scale by correlation of the\\nexact solutions for given velocity and a constant product of\\nambient density and nose radius .  this similitude, which can\\nalso scale viscous nonequilibrium and radiation phenomena in the\\nshock layer, provides a useful flexibility for hypersonic testing\\nwhere it is applicable .\\n  the afterbody inviscid-flow

dimensional transonic flow past airfoils .\\n  this report concerns the problem of constructing solutions for\\ntransonic flows over symmetric airfoils .  the aspect of the problem\\nemphasized is, of necessity, not how to form a solution for compressible\\nflow but how to simplify the initial phase of the problem, namely, the\\nmapping of the incompressible flow .  in the case of the symmetric\\njoukowski airfoil without circulation, the mapping is relatively simple,\\nbut the coefficients in the power series are difficult to evaluate .  as\\na result, the problem requires simplification .  instead of the exact\\nincompressible flow past the airfoil, an approximate flow is used, which\\nis derived from a combination of source and sink .  this flow differs\\nonly slightly from the exact one when the thickness is small .  by the\\nsame method, the flow with circulation is also considered .\\n  after the incompressible-flow functions are approximated in this\\nfashion, the numerical calculation of the corresponding compressible\\nflow, by the hodograph theory, does not present any\\nessential difficulty .\\n.I 405\\n.T\\ntables of thermal properties

nominal zero longitudinal pressure and temperature\\ngradients .\\nit is shown that the empirical/intermediate enthalpy/used with success\\nin approximations for skin friction, etc., of laminar boundary layers is\\nclosely the same as the mean enthalpy with respect to velocity .\\nfurthermore, the mean enthalpics of laminar and turbulent boundary\\nlayers may be the same . a nonrigorous approach is made to the problems\\nof self-induced pressure gradients, and the indications are that their\\neffects on laminar skin friction, etc., may become noticeable at mach\\nnumbers greater than 5 and they increase as the surface temperature\\nbuilds up towards zero heat-transfer conditions . the effects with\\nturbulent boundary layers may not be so severe .\\nfinally, the results are applied to give an idea of the magnitude of the\\ndrag and aerodynamic heating problems up to m 10, and one result is\\nthat, if there is any conflict at the higher mach numbers between\\nsurface conditions required for high radiative emissivity and those\\nwhich may be thought necessary for preserving a laminar boundary layer,\\nthen it may be better to choose the former .\\n.I

(for parts 1 and 2, cf. the same\\nquart. 3, 117-142, 218-234 (1945),. these rev. 7,225,226 .)\\nthe stability character of a viscous fluid is considered in\\ndetail .  the author proceeds first to give a proof of a criterion\\nof stability due to heisenberg ..  if a velocity profile has an\\nnumber and phase velocity, the disturbance with the same\\nwave number is unstable in the real fluid when the reynolds\\nnumber is sufficiently large .  this destabilizing effect of\\nviscosity is one of the most interesting phenomena in the\\ngeneral stability theory,. its physical and mathematical\\nsignificance is carefully discussed .\\n  the author then discusses the behavior of the so-called\\nneutral curve for the two characteristic types of\\nvelocity distribution, the boundary layer type profile and\\nthe symmetrical profile .  the asymptotic behavior of the\\nneutral curve is discussed first .  the main difference between\\nprofiles with and without a point of inflection is that the two\\nbranches of the neutral curve approach and for\\nprofiles with a flex, but both converge to for the profile\\nwithout a flex .  the most important results are as follows .\\nfor sufficiently large reynolds number r .  (2) there always\\nexists a minimum r below which the motion is stable .  a\\nsimilar result was obtained by synge from energy\\nconsiderations .  synge found a limiting curve below which the\\nmotion is necessarily stable .  the author's discussion of the\\nasymptotic behavior of the curves shows further\\nthat there always exists a maximum value of a beyond\\nwhich the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers .  hence\\nthe qualitative shape of the curve is determined .\\n  the author proceeds to show that simple approximate\\nexpressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his\\ngeneral analysis for a given velocity profile .  these\\napproximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius\\nflow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 .  the reynolds\\nnumbers are based on the width of the channel and the\\ndisplacement thickness, respectively .  finally, the method\\nfor computing the complete instability curve is presented\\nand the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked\\nout in detail .  the stability limit for blasius flow had been\\ngiven before by tollmien and schlichting .  the present more\\nexact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far\\nas the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned .\\nthe value found here is r=420 .  the neutral curve for\\npoiseuille motion had not been obtained before .  the\\nminimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 .  the\\nagreement with the estimate from the simple criterion\\nmentioned above is thus very good .\\n  a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous\\neffects and of future developments concludes the paper .\\n.I 418\\n.T\\ntransition form laminar to turbulent shear flow .\\n.A\\nmorkovin,m.v.\\n.B\\nasme trans, 80, 1958,1121.\\n.W\\ntransition form laminar to turbulent shear flow .\\n  recent experimental studies of transition from laminar to\\nturbulent shear flows are reviewed .  certain common features\\nare emphasized and related to the stability theories of viscous\\nshear layers .  the three-dimensional character, the\\nunsteadiness, and the nonlinear and random behavior of the latter stages\\nof the transition process are also examined .\\n.I 419\\n.T\\nthe design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on web\\nplates subjected to shear .\\n.A\\nrockey,k.c.\\n.B\\naero. quart. 1956, 275.\\n.W\\nthe design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on web\\nplates subjected to shear .\\n  the correct design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on web plates\\nsubjected to shear becomes very important when\\nthe web plates are designed\\nto operate at loads close to their buckling loads .\\nthis paper presents details\\nof an extensive series of tests conducted on\\nstiffened web plates subjected to\\nshear .  from the analysis of the results obtained\\nfrom these tests, new empirical\\nrelationships between the flexural rigidity and\\nspacing of the intermediate\\nstiffeners and the buckling stress of the stiffened\\nweb plate have been obtained .\\n  one interesting and important feature of\\nthese new relationships is that\\nthey define more clearly than hitherto the difference\\nin the behaviour of\\nsingle-and double-sided stiffeners .\\n.I 420\\n.T\\nan experimental study of the flow field about swept and delta wings\\nwith sharp leading edges .\\n.A\\njaszlics, i. and trilling, l.\\n.B\\nj. aero. sc. august 1959 . p 487 -

supersonic speeds .\\n  a theoretical investigation has been made of a general method for\\npredicting the flow field behind the wings of plane and cruciform wing\\nand body combinations at transonic or supersonic speeds and slender\\nconfigurations at subsonic speeds .  the wing trailing-vortex wake is\\nrepresented initially by line vortices distributed to approximate the\\nspanwise distribution of circulation along the trailing edge of the\\nexposed wing panels .  the afterbody is represented by corresponding\\nimage vortices within the body .  two-dimensional line-vortex theory is\\nthen used to compute the induced velocities at each vortex and the\\nresulting displacement of each vortex is determined by means of a\\nnumerical stepwise integration procedure .  the method was applied to the\\ncalculation of the position of the vortex wake and the estimation of\\ndownwash at chosen tail locations behind triangular-wing and\\ncylindrical-body combinations at supersonic speeds .  the effects of\\nsuch geometric parameters as aspect ratio, angle of attack and\\nincidence, ratio of body radius to wing semi-span, and angle of bank on\\nthe vortex wake behind wings of wing-body combinations were studied .\\nthe relative importance of wing vortices, the corresponding image\\nvortices within the body, and body crossflow indetermining the the total\\ndownwash was assessed at a possible tail location .\\n  it was found that the line-vortex method of this report permitted\\nthe calculation of vortex paths behind wings of wing-body combinations\\nwith reasonable facility and accuracy .  a calculated sample wake shape\\nagreed qualitatively with one observed experimentally, and sample\\nresults of the line-vortex method compared well with an available exact\\ncrossflow-plane solution .  an empirical formula was derived to estimate\\nthe number  of vortices required per wing panel for a satisfactory\\ncomputation of downwash at tail locations .  it was found that the shape\\nof the vortex wake and the ultimate number of rolled-up vortices behind\\na wing depend on the circulation distribution along the wing trailing\\nedge .  for the low-aspect-ratio plane wing and body combinations\\nconsidered, it appeared that downwash at horizontal tail locations is\\nlargely determined except near the tail-body juncture by the wing\\nvortices alone for small ratios of body radius to wing semispan, and by\\nthe body upwash alone for large values of that ratio .\\n.I 434\\n.T\\ncontributions of the wing panels to the forces and\\nmoments of

naca\\ntechnical note 1211 by lindsey, daley, and humphreys .  the flow on the\\nupper surface behind the leading edge of an airfoil at an angle of\\nattack changed abruptly from detached flow with an extensive region of\\nseparation to attached supersonic flow terminated by a shock wave .  in\\nthe present paper, the consequences of shock-wave--boundary-layer\\ninteraction are proposed as a factor that may be important in determining the\\nconditions under which the change in flow pattern occurs .  when the\\nmach number is high enough, the attached-flow pattern exists because\\nthen the shock wave is far enough behind the leading edge to keep the\\ninfluence of the high pressure behind the shock wave from extending\\nthrough the boundary layer to the immediate vicinity of the leading edge\\nand affecting the flow there .  some experimental evidence in support of\\nthe importance of shock-wave--boundary-layer interaction is presented .\\n.I 440\\n.T\\ncompilation of information on

first,\\nusing the m.i.t.-naca airfoil oscillator, the aerodynamic reactions on\\nwings oscillating harmonically in pitch and translation in the stall\\nrange have been measured, evaluated, and correlated where possible with\\navailable published data, with the purpose of providing empirical\\ninformation where no aerodynamic theory exists .  the major effects of\\nreynolds number, airfoil shape, and reduced frequency on the aerodynamic\\nreactions have been reaffirmed .  no instances of negative damping were\\nobserved in pure translatory motion and the ranges of negative damping\\noccurring in pure pitch had the same general trends noted by other\\nexperimenters .  data on the time-average values in the stall range of\\nboth lift and moment are presented for the first time .\\n  second, the results of numerous experimental observations of stall\\nflutter have been reviewed and the various known attempts at its\\nprediction have been examined, compared, and extended .  the sharp drop in\\ncritical speed and change to a predominantly torsional oscillation\\nusually associated with the transition from classical to stall flutter\\nis apparently primarily but not entirely caused by the marked changes\\nin moment due to pitch .  fairly good stall-flutter predictions have\\nbeen reported only when adequate empirical data for this aerodynamic\\nreaction happened to be available for the desired airfoil shape,\\nreynolds number range, and reduced-frequency range .  a semiempirical\\nmethod of predicting the variations of moment in pitch with airfoil\\nshape,

at very low values of\\nthe relative-density parameter .  for these low values\\nthe analytical considerations employed indicated a freedom from flutter\\nnot found experimentally .  at higher values

the\\nlight of low-speed flight requirements, with the aim of seeking\\naerodynamic processes which might be exploited to enhance law-speed\\nperformance .\\none aspect of propeller-driven aircraft which has recently received\\nincreasing attention is the existence of strong gradients of\\nlongitudinal velocity, or shear, in the propeller slipstream .  this\\nslipstream shear interacts with a wing surface and can alter the wing\\ncharacteristics .  in theoretical treatments of a wing interacting with\\na propeller slipstream, the first important simplification is the\\nreplacement of the slipstream with an ideal uniform\\njet, free of all velocity\\ngradients .  the application of these theories requires that one equate\\nthe actual slipstream to an effective uniform jet .  one method\\nemployed is to assume the uniform jet has a momentum flux equal to the\\naverage in the propeller slipstream .  these and similar procedures\\nare well founded on momentum considerations., however, the implicit\\nassumption is that the flow nonuniformity, the shear, does not influence\\nthe wing characteristics .\\n.I 454\\n.T\\nseveral approximate analyses of the bending of a

obtained in a simulated\\ntwo-dimensional slipstream .  the experimental results show\\nthat when positioned near the slipstream plane of symmetry, the\\nairfoil maximum lift varies markedly with location in the\\nslipstream .  in moving the airfoil from above to below the\\nslipstream plane of symmetry through a total distance corresponding\\nto the airfoil thickness, force data and boundary-layer\\nobservations show that boundary-layer separation is delayed to higher\\nangles of attack, and the airfoil maximum lift is doubled .\\n  it is concluded that the destalling effect observed in the\\nnon-uniform slipstream is not associated with slipstream boundary\\ninterference, but stems from the influence of the large local\\nslipstream shear on airfoil characteristics .  the effects of uniform\\nand nonuniform shear on airfoil lift and pressure distribution are\\ndiscussed, within the framework of existing first-order,\\nsmall-shear theory, to show that these effects of shear tend to promote\\nstall .  a pohlhausen calculation of the laminar boundary layer\\nin a stream with shear is used to identify and to assess the effects\\nof stream shear on boundary-layer separation criteria .  it is\\ndemonstrated that these effects are negligibly small, and that the\\nuniform-flow criterion applies .  it is concluded on the basis of\\nthe experimental data that the observed destalling phenomenon\\nstems from a shear effect of higher order than those treated in the\\ninviscid theories .  it is hypothesized that it is a second-order\\neffect, fixed by the product of the stream shear and the derivative\\nof the shear, which was large in the present experiments .\\n.I 485\\n.T\\nlinear heat flow in a composite slab .\\n.A\\nreid,w.p.\\n.B\\nj.ae.scs. 29,

at each\\npoint in the boundary layer and diffusion effects were neglected .\\nthe solutions to the boundary-layer equations were carried out\\non a high-speed digital computing machine, both skin-friction and\\nheat-transfer coefficients being obtained from the computations .\\n  before presenting the results, the t' method of rubesin and\\njohnson for computing skin-friction coefficients

this equation would have been\\ncon-damped sinusoids .  in ballistics any slow variation of these\\ncoefstant, and the solution would have been simply the\\nexponentially-ficients is usually treated by adding an approximate correction\\nterm to the damping rate (which is spoken of as the wkb\\nperturbation) .  however, with a body entering the planetary atmosphere the\\nvariation of the air

the\\nprandtl number is unity .  (these assumptions\\nmay be compared with the empirical relations\\nsuggested by cope .)\\nit is shown that a transformation of the ordinate\\nnormal to the layer can lead to a simplified\\nform of

.\\n  after an extensive survey of mean-velocity profile measurements\\nin various two-dimensional incompressible turbulent\\nboundary-layer flows, it is proposed to represent the profile by a linear\\ncombination of two universal functions .  one is the well-known\\nlaw of the wall .  the other, called the law of the wake, is\\ncharacterized by the profile at a point of separation or reattachment .\\nthese functions are considered to be established empirically, by\\na study of the mean-velocity profile, without reference to any\\nhypothetical mechanism of turbulence .  using the resulting\\ncomplete analytic representation for the mean-velocity field,\\nthe shearing-stress field for several flows is computed from the\\nboundary-layer equations and compared with experimental data .\\n  the development of a turbulent boundary layer is ultimately\\ninterpreted in terms of an equivalent wake profile, which supposedly\\nrepresents the large-eddy structure and is a consequence of the\\nconstraint provided by inertia .  this equivalent wake profile is\\nmodified by the presence of a wall, at which a further constraint is\\nprovided by viscosity .  the wall constraint, although it penetrates\\nthe entire boundary layer, is manifested chiefly in the sublayer flow\\nand in the logarithmic profile near the wall .\\n  finally, it is suggested that yawed or three-dimensional flows\\nmay be usefully represented by the same two universal functions,\\nconsidered as vector rather than scalar quantities .  if the wall\\ncomponent is defined to be in the direction of the surface shearing\\nstress, then the wake component, at least in the few cases studied,\\nis found to be very nearly parallel to the gradient of the pressure .\\n.I 564\\n.T\\nlocal

under these\\nconditions the piston is brought to rest with no overswing .  some\\nmeasurements of the piston motion using a microwave technique are\\nreported which confirm this idea .\\n  the wave

be considerably greater than the driving pressure if the driving\\nchamber cross-sectional area is large compared with that of the driven\\nsection .  for a uniform shock tube the stagnation pressure will always\\nbe less than the driving pressure .  the use of air, helium and\\nhydrogen as driving gases has been considered .\\n  experiments in a gun tunnel are reported which show that the\\nequilibrium piston technique enables steady stagnation pressures to be\\nachieved over a time of approximately 15 ms using air as the driving\\ngas .  the expansion caused by the piston

locations .\\n  an investigation was conducted in the n. a. c. a.\\nfull-scale wind tunnel on a small parasol monoplane\\nequipped with three different split trailing-edge wing\\nflaps .  the object of the investigation was to determine\\nand correlate data on the characteristics of the airplane\\nand flaps as affected by variation in flap chord, flap\\ndeflection, and flap location along the wing chord .  the\\nchords of the flaps were 10, 20, and 30 percent of the\\nwing chord and each flap was tested at deflections from 0\\nto 75 when located successively at 68, 80, and 88.8\\npercent of the wing chord aft of the leading edge .  the\\ninvestigation included force tests, pressure-distribution\\ntests, and downwash surveys .  the results give the lift,\\nthe drag, and the pitching-moment characteristics of the\\nairplane, the flap forces and moments, the pressure\\ndistribution over the flaps and wing at one section,\\nand the downwash characteristics of the flap and wing\\ncombinations .\\n  an increase in flap chord or distance of the flap from\\nthe leading edge of the wing increased the lift of the\\nairplane but had an adverse effect on the wing pitching\\nmoment .  the ld ratio of the airplane decreased with\\nincrease in flap deflection or flap chord .  flap\\nnormal-force coefficients were primarily a function of flap\\ndeflection and were relatively independent of flap chord,\\nhinge-axis location, and airplane attitude .  the location of\\nthe flap center of pressure in percentage of flap chord aft of\\nthe hinge axis remained practically constant\\nirrespective of airplane attitude and of flap deflection, chord, or\\nlocation .  flap hinge-moment coefficients varied with a\\npower of flap chord greater than the square so that with\\nregard to hinge moments narrow flaps were the most\\nefficient in producing a given increase in lift .\\n  split trailing-edge flaps materially affected the\\nmagnitude and distribution of pressures over the entire wing\\nprofile .  at low angles of attack the predominant effect\\nof the flaps was to increase positively the lower-surface\\npressures ,. at high angles of attack, to increase negatively\\nthe upper-surface pressures .  downwash surveys\\nindicated that horizontal tail planes located above the wing\\nchord line would be more effective than those below the\\nchord in counteracting the increased diving moment of\\nthe airplane with flaps deflected .\\n.I 674\\n.T\\nthe shapes and lift-dependent drags on some sweptback\\nwings designed for m= 1.

.\\na generalised conical flow theory is used to deduce an integral equation\\n relating the velocity potential on a delta wing/with subsonic leading\\nedges/to the given downwash distribution over

supersonic speeds .\\nin an attempt to avoid flow separation at the leading edge of a thin\\ndelta wing with subsonic leading edges, an attachment line is prescribed\\n there . this is done by requiring the load, as predicted by attached\\nflow theory, to vanish along the leading edge at the design lift\\ncoefficient . for sonic speed, a complete account of this flow is given\\nin terms of slender wing theory and the load distributions corresponding\\n to arbitrary conical camber are calculated . for supersonic speeds\\nload distributions arising in the slender wing theory are considered and\\n the corresponding conical camber distributions are found by linearized\\ntheory . the lift-dependent drag for a given lift is then minimized with\\n respect to the coefficients of a linear combination of these load\\ndistributions . it is found that the lift-dependent drag factor for these\\nconically cambered wings approaches the value it takes for the attached\\nflow/in which leading edge suction occurs/past the uncambered wing at\\nthe same mach number, as more terms are included in the linear\\ncombination . however, when the leading edge is almost sonic an appreciable\\nreduction is predicted . the corresponding load distributions and wing\\nshapes are calculated and drawn . the optimum shapes for a fixed number\\nof terms resemble flat plates drooped downwards near their edges, so\\nthat the localised leading edge suction is replaced by a distributed\\nforce on a forward-facing surface, producing an effect of similar\\nmagnitude .\\n.I

fluctuating pressures that\\nmay cause structural fatigue .  studies of such structures have\\nbeen limited by lack of knowledge of the loadings involved .\\n  the acoustic near field produced by the exhaust of a stationary\\nturbojet engine having a high pressure ratio was measured for\\na single operating condition without afterburning .  the\\nmaximum over-all sound pressure without afterburning was found\\nto be about 42 pounds per square foot along the jet boundary in\\nthe region immediately downstream of the jet-nozzle exit .\\nwith afterburning the maximum sound pressure was increased\\nby 50 percent .  the largest sound pressures without\\nafterburning were obtained on a constant percentage band width basis in\\nthe frequency range from 350 to 700 cps .\\n  additional tests were made at a few points to find the effect\\nof jet velocity on near-field sound pressures and to determine\\nthe difference in value between sound-pressure levels at rigid\\nsurfaces and corresponding free-field values .  near the jet\\nnozzle, over-all sound pressures were found to vary as a low\\npower (approx. unity) of the jet velocity .  over-all sound-pressure\\nlevels considerably greater than the corresponding free-field\\nlevels were recorded at the surface of a rigid plate placed along\\nthe jet boundary .\\n  the downstream locations of the maximum sound pressure\\nat any given frequency along the jet-engine-exhaust boundary\\nand the longitudinal turbulent-velocity maximum of the same\\nfrequency along a small cold-air jet at 1 nozzle-exit radius from\\nthe jet axis were found to be nearly the same when compared on\\na dimensionless basis .  also, the strouhal number of the\\ncorresponding spectra maximums was found to be nearly equal at\\nsimilar distances downstream .\\n  in addition to the magnitude and frequency distribution of\\nthe acoustic pressures, it is necessary to know the cross\\ncorrelation of the pressure over the surface area .  cross-correlation\\nmeasurements with microphones were made for a range of jet\\nvelocities at locations along the jet and at a distance from the\\njet .  free-field correlations of the over-all sound pressure and\\nof the sound pressure in frequency bands from 100 to 1000 cps\\nwere obtained both longitudinally and laterally .  in addition,\\ncorrelations were obtained with microphones mounted at the\\nsurface of a rigid plate that was large compared with the\\ndistance over which a positive correlation existed .\\n  the region of positive correlation was generally found to\\nincrease with distance downstream of the engine to 6.5\\nnozzle-exit diameters, but remained nearly constant thereafter .  in\\ngeneral, little change in the correlation curves was found as a\\nfunction of jet velocity or frequency-band width .  the distance\\nfrom unity correlation to the first zero correlation was greater for\\nlateral than for longitudinal correlations for the same\\nconditions and locations .  the correlation curves obtained in free\\nspace and on the surface of the plate were generally similar .\\n  the results are interpreted in terms of pressure loads

karman,t. and tsien,h.s.\\n.B\\nj. ae. scs. 8, 1941, 303.\\n.W\\nthe buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial\\ncompression .\\nin two previous papers the authors have discussed\\nin detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of\\nthin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of\\ncylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that\\nnot only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times\\nhigher than that found by experiments, but the\\nobserved wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different\\nfrom that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed\\nout that the different explanations for this discrepancy\\nadvanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are\\nuntenable when certain conclusions drawn from these\\nexplanations are compared with the experimental facts .\\nby a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the\\nauthors were led to the belief that in general the\\nbuckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be\\nexplained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .\\nthis point of view was substantiated by model\\nexperiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic\\nsupport .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures\\ncause the load necessary to keep the shell in\\nequilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave\\namplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first\\nof all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is\\nreleased once the buckling has started,. this explains\\nthe observed rapidity of the buckling process .\\nfurthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers\\nthe buckling load itself can be materially reduced by\\nslight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations\\nduring the testing process .\\n  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case\\nof a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial\\ncompression .  first it is shown by an approximate\\ncalculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops\\nwith increasing deflection .  then the results of this\\ncalculation are used for a more detailed discussion of\\nthe buckling process as observed in an actual testing\\nmachine .\\n.I 740\\n.T\\nthe behaviour of a cylindrical

southwell (1914) .  subsequent\\nexperimental results, however, have indicated that this\\nvalue is appreciably too high and that the form of distortion\\nwhich occurs in practice differs from that assumed in theory .\\n  in recent years much work has been done on this problem\\nin america .  lundquist (1933) and donnell (1934)\\nhave concluded that the buckling of a cylindrical shell is greatly\\ninfluenced by initial irregularities,. von karman and\\ntsien (1941) have indicated that a thin cylindrical shell can be\\nmaintained in a buckled state by a compressive load\\nconsiderably smaller than that previously predicted by theory .\\n  the present paper is an extension of the work of von karman\\nand tsien .  it shows that the smallest load which will\\nkeep a thin cylindrical shell in a buckled condition is about one-third\\nof that given by southwell, a result in very fair\\nagreement with experiment, and that once the cylinder has buckled,\\nand so long as the stresses remain within the elastic\\nrange of the material, the cylinder has only about one-quarter of its\\noriginal stiffness .\\n.I 741\\n.T\\nthe behaviour of thin cylindrical shells after buckling\\nunder

.  the growth\\nand movement of the two main surface shocks (the rear and\\nforward shocks) is discussed, and conditions for\\nflow separation through these shocks are considered .  for\\nthe rear shock, which has little sweep, these\\nconditions are similar to those for shock-induced separation\\non two-dimensional aerofoils .  the forward\\nshock is comparatively highly swept and separation seems\\nto correspond to two rather different but\\nsimultaneously-attained conditions, one related to the\\ncomponent mach number normal to the shock front\\nand the other to the position of the reattachment line .\\n  the flow in the region between the leading edge and\\nthe forward shock is shown to have certain characteristics\\nanalogous to those found upstream of the shock on\\ntwo-dimensional aerofoils .  to the rear of the forward\\nshock, but ahead of the rear shock, the flow at low\\nsupersonic speeds resembles in some respects that about\\na simple cone .\\n  the general flow development is related in the\\ntext to the wing lift and pitching moment, and the drag .\\nthe first two are most affected by the aft movement\\nof the rear shock, which also stimulates the transonic\\ndrag rise .  the lift-dependent drag is shown to be\\ninfluenced by the appearance of leading-edge separation\\nand possibly also by some stage in the development\\nof the forward

second international\\ncongress in aeronautical sciences at zurich in 1960, as suitable for\\nachieving a required range at supersonic speeds, namely wingbody\\narrangements with sweepback angles of 55degrees or 60degrees and\\nstreamwise thickness-chord ratio of about 5 per cent suitable for low\\nsupersonic speed, and slender near-triangular wings with sharp leading\\nedges suitable for mach numbers of about 2 or more .\\nno attention is given to /slewed/ wings, powered lift or variable\\ngeometry .\\nin dealing briefly with swept wings, the need for avoiding separation of\\n flow from the leading edge is demonstrated, with the conclusion that it\\n is desirable to use leading edge flaps with blowing or suction at the\\nknee together with blown trailing edge flaps . wind tunnel tests are\\ndescribed on a simplified model with these boundary layer control\\nmethods applied . mention is made of the possibility of adverse ground\\neffect on maximum lift .\\nmore attention is given to the case of slender wings because their use\\ninvolves a new type of flow with separation from all edges . this flow\\nand its steadiness are therefore discussed from the point of view of\\nthe possibility of buffeting,. the effect of plan form on static\\nlongitudinal stability and pitch-up is analysed,. and a short summary of\\n available results on damping in pitch is given . large rolling moments\\ndue to sideslip are shown to give rise to serious problems of control,\\nand the present state of knowledge of static lateral and directional\\nstability and rolling and yawing rotary derivatives is discussed .\\nfinally the effects of proximity to the ground are summarised .\\nthe second part of the paper is concerned with work aimed at clarifying\\nsome of the requirements for handling qualities of future aircraft . it\\nis not so much concerned with forecasts of the dynamic behaviour of\\nthese future aircraft as with determining what the pilot wants .\\ntwo aspects of control in the vertical plane are discussed in some\\ndetail namely speed control and glide path holding . flight tests on an\\navro 707a aircraft, with artificially worsened characteristics, are\\ndescribed, and it is shown that substantially constant performance in the\\npiloting task can be achieved at the expense of increased pilot effort .\\n some tentative conclusions on desirable levels of speed stability and\\nphugoid damping are, nevertheless, drawn .\\na brief review of the present status of lateral/directional handling\\nrequirements, using mainly american data, is also included .\\n.I 793\\n.T\\nthe flow pattern on a tapered sweptback wing at mach numbers between 0.6\\n and 1.6 .\\n.A\\nhall, i.m. and rogers, e.w.e.\\n.B\\na.r.c. r + m 3271, part 1, july 1960

force measurements . these are discussed\\nin relation to the flow development in this part of the report .\\nthe wing was tested at mach numbers between 0 6 and 1 6 for incidences\\nup to about 14 deg . the tunnel stagnation pressure was held constant at\\na value near atmospheric pressure during the tests, so that the reynolds\\n number varied with mach number .. at m 1 0 it was 2 3 x 10 based on the\\n mean aerodynamic chord . boundary-layer transition was fixed by a\\nroughness band at the leading edge .\\na detailed analysis has been made of the pressure distributions on the\\nsurface of the wing and the chordwise distributions integrated to\\ndetermine the spanwise loading . the overall lift and pitching moment of\\n the wing were also obtained from these data, as well as from direct\\nmeasurements using a strain-gauge balance, by means of which the wing\\ndrag was also determined . these results are considered in some detail\\nto illustrate the effects of mach number and incidence on the flow about\\n the model . a preliminary analysis is also made of the conditions for\\nboundary-layer separation due to shock waves on the wing surface . the\\nprincipal factor appears to be the component of mach number normal to\\nthe shock front .\\n.I 795\\n.T\\nthe operation of the npl 18in x 14in. wind tunnel in the transonic speed\\n range .\\n.A\\nhall, i.m.\\n.B\\na.r.c.

first 5( and 10( respectively of the local chord . use of\\nlarger grain sizes, or increases in the band width for a given grain\\nsize resulted in a drag penalty . with very large particle sizes /about\\nbetween the particles . the drag penalty was constant over the test mach\\n number range /0.80 to 1.15/ and decreased slowly with incidence . the\\nwing lift and pitching moment were only slightly modified by the\\npresence of any of the roughness bands tested, but this result would not\\n of course necessarily apply to wings of other planforms or section\\nshapes . the test reynolds

20 . seven leading-edge profiles were\\ntested, ranging from a drooped extension of 18 per cent of the chord of\\nthe basic sharp-nosed section to a round-nosed section with a\\nleading-edge radius of 1 0 per cent of the basic chord .\\nleading-edge droop was found to increase the wing drag near zero lift\\nbut to reduce appreciably the lift-dependent drag component, except at\\nthe highest test mach numbers . droop also increased the lift\\ncoefficient at which leading-edge separation occurred on the upper surface\\nat moderate subsonic speeds, but in addition reduced the mach number for\\n transonic flow attachment . the appearance of the forward shock /but\\nnot the rear shock/ is considerably delayed when the leading edge is\\ndrooped .\\nwith the undrooped sections an increase in leading-edge radius was\\naccompanied by successively earlier appearances of the forward shock,\\nand hence the outboard shock with its attendant separation . the\\nconditions at which the rear shock first appeared changed only slowly as the\\nsection was changed .\\nthe variations in wing flow pattern as the leading edge is modified are\\ndiscussed and related to measured changes in the wing lift and drag .\\nan attempt is also made to estimate the local mach numbers on some parts\\n of the wing from the oil-flow patterns,. this material is used to\\nassess the flow conditions appropriate to shock-induced separation .\\nthe main section of the report concludes with a tentative discussion of\\nthe significance of the present results to the design of swept wings .\\nin an appendix results

note on the\\neffects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes .\\nthe interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important\\neffects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been\\nwritten as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical\\nreview of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying\\nphysical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to\\nthe reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our\\nknowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a\\nfundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem\\nis understood sufficiently well for design purposes .\\npart i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types\\nof flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the\\n development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction\\n depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of\\nthe shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a\\nlaminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if\\nthe boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of\\nthe interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences\\nit is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the\\ndifference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers\\narises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in\\nan adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream\\n of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the\\nseparated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the\\nsurface .\\nmany of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in\\n practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of\\nthe paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of\\naerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the\\ninteraction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and\\nin supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences\\nbetween the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are\\noften a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and\\nfull-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore,\\nfrequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial\\nmeans . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of\\nthe more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that\\nexperiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a\\nnumber of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and\\nconnected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the\\nturbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight\\n and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a\\ncertain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions\\nfull-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if\\nthe pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and\\nthe trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information\\n is at present available on this point .\\nmost of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion\\ncharacteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated\\nreduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this\\nis because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation\\n between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge\\nremains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock\\n waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain\\n unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface\\nseparation .\\nsome evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the\\noccurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other\\nrespects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce .\\nsome notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of\\n the paper .\\n.I 799\\n.T\\nsome effects of wind-tunnel interference observed in tests on\\ntwo-dimensional aerofoils at high subsonic and transonic speeds

subsonic and transonic speeds .\\nin the high-speed research on two-dimensional aerofoils at the national\\nphysical laboratory the need to keep model size above a certain minimum,\\n in order to reproduce correctly the boundary layer separation effects\\nexperienced at full scale, has been considered paramount even at the\\nrisk of incurring significant tunnel interference effects .\\nthis report discusses the interference effects for the slotted working\\nsections now in use . the magnitudes of the blockage and lift effect\\ncorrections are deduced for the ratio of model chord to tunnel height\\nnormally used . it is shown that a simple adaptation to reduce the open\\narea of the walls would reduce both corrections to insignificant\\nproportions simultaneously, but would give a reduced choking mach number\\nseparated flows . the observed trends in the variation of the blockage\\neffects for other ratios of model chord to tunnel height differ from\\nthose predicted theoretically, and so the results cannot be applied more\\n generally until these trends have been checked by further\\ninvestigations .\\nit is suggested that wake interference effects can significantly\\ninfluence the manner in which separated flows develop with increasing\\nincidence or mach number, particularly for walls of small open area .\\nexamples are also given of effects of distortions in the local\\nsupersonic flow, which are most noticeable for walls with relatively large\\nopen areas .\\n.I 800\\n.T\\nwall interference at transonic speeds on a hemisphere cylinder

and 1.1 at zero model incidence, and schlieren photographs\\nwere taken . the blockage ratios were 0.211(, 0.117( and 0.120( .\\nthe principal feature of the flow is the effect of working section size\\non the rate at which the terminal shock wave moves back along the model\\nwith increasing stream mach number . this is thought to depend mainly\\non the distance from the model to the slotted walls of the tunnel,\\nand not necessarily on the blockage ratio . the distance of the solid\\nsidewall is important in influencing the local mach number ahead of the\\nterminal shock, by reflecting the expansion-wave system originating near\\n the model nose .\\n.I 801\\n.T\\nexperimental study of the equivalence of transonic\\nflow about slender cone-cylinders of circular and elliptic\\ncross

study are a\\nflat, winglike, elliptic cone-cylinder and its equivalent body of\\nrevolution, a circular cone-cylinder .  it is determined that the flows\\nabout the two models are closely related in the manner predicted by the\\ntheory, the relationship persisting over a mach number range of 0.92 to\\ncone-cylinder vary linearly only over the small angle-of-attack range of\\napproximately 1 and that the aerodynamic loading at sonic speed compares\\nfavorably with jones' slender-wing theory .\\n  the results of the investigation suggest that at transonic speeds and\\nat small angles of attack the calculation of all aerodynamic\\ncharacteristics of slender, three-dimensional shapes can be made by use\\nof transonic slender-body theory when the pressures on the equivalent\\nbody of revolution are known, either by experiment, or by an adequate\\nnonlinear theory .  from transonic slender-body theory it is deduced\\nthat the slenderness required for this application is the same as that\\nrequired for the successful application of the transonic area rule .\\n.I 802\\n.T\\nthe behaviour of supersonic flow past a body of revolution\\nfar from the axis

(a similar, but not quite as\\ngeneral, method was derived by walkden in\\nref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only the\\nvolume term, has been used extensively to predict\\nthe boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies\\nand the agreement with experiment has, so far,\\nbeen quite reasonable .  the test data obtained\\nto date extends only up to about 40,000 ft.\\naltitude and the calculations of this paper show\\nthat under those conditions the shock noise of\\nthe aircraft tested so far will, in most cases,\\nbe dominated by the volume term .  it is shown\\nthat at higher altitudes lifting effects will\\ndominate for even the small fighter and they will\\ndominate over most of the altitude range\\nfor large bomber and supersonic transport\\naircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreases\\nwith altitude as which compares to\\nin the volume case (=pressure at\\naltitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number,\\nwing loading, wing plan shape and\\nlift distribution .  a simple rule for calculating\\nthe shock noise due to combined volume and\\nlifting effects is proposed which is applicable to\\nconfigurations with wings located towards the\\nrear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shock\\nnoise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal\\nto the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift)\\nor the shock noise due to lift (neglecting\\nvolume), whichever is the greater .  a chart is\\npresented from which rapid estimates can be\\nmade of the shock noise of lifting\\nwing-body combinations .\\n.I 812\\n.T\\ninvestigation of two bluff shapes in axial free

mach number range and at reynolds\\nnumbers from 1.74 x 10 to 2.78 x 10, based on body diameter .\\n  a full-skirted rather than a short-skirted type of shape developed\\nthe greatest amount of static

longitudinal axis generally increased the lift and reduced the\\npitching moment at angles of attack and reduced the aerodynamic static\\nstability parameter through the transonic mach number range .  the\\nextension of segmented clamshell-shaped flaps from the afterbody of a\\nshort-skirted model served to increase the lift and static stability\\nonly if the flaps extended into the airstream .\\n  some evidence was found of oscillatory base pressures on two\\ndissimilar shapes at certain high angles of attack and the highest mach\\nnumber in these tests .  there is doubt, however, that these

form, rests upon the\\nwell-established uniaxial stress-strain relation .  the development of\\na correspondingly satisfactory theory for the plastic buckling of\\nplates has been hampered by the nonexistence of an established\\npolyaxial stress-strain relation in the plastic range .\\n  present theories for the polyaxial stress-strain relation beyond\\nthe elastic range can be divided into two types, often called flow\\nand deformation theories .  theories of plastic buckling based on\\ndeformation theories are in better agreement with experiment\\nthan those based on flow theories .  on the other hand, tests in\\nwhich a material is compressed into the plastic range and then\\nsubjected to shear at constant compressive stress are in better\\nagreement with flow than with deformation theories .  legitimate\\ndoubt therefore has existed as to the validity of any theory for\\nthe plastic buckling of plates .\\n  as a result of studying these apparent contradictions, a new\\ntheory of plasticity has been developed which is of neither the\\nflow nor the deformation type .  it is based upon the concept of\\nslip, and its formulation was guided more by physical, and less\\nby mathematical, considerations than previous theories .\\nexperimental evidence of limited scope but of crucial character is in\\nbetter agreement with the new theory than with either flow

imperfections .\\n  it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that extremely\\nsmall, and therefore unavoidable, imperfections of shape do\\naccount for the paradox in a simple manner .  the buckling load is\\nshown to be extremely insensitive to the amount of imperfection .\\nthe example chosen is a simplified version of the long rectangular\\nplate hinged along one edge and free on the

bending and stretching of sandwich type shells .\\n  a theory has been developed for small bending and stretching of\\nsandwich-type shells .  this theory is an extension of the known theory\\nof homogeneous thin elastic shells .  it was found that two effects are\\nimportant in the present problem, which have not been considered\\npreviously in the theory of curved shells ..  (1) the effect of\\ntransverse shear deformation and (2) the effect of transverse normal stress\\ndeformation .  the first of these two effects has been known to be of\\nimportance in the theory of plates and beams .  the second effect was\\nfound to occur in a manner which is typical for shells and has no\\ncounterpart in flat-plate theory .\\n  the general results of this report have been applied to the\\nsolution of problems concerning flat plates, circular rings, circular\\ncylindrical shells, and spherical shells .  in each case numerical\\nexamples have been given, illustrating the magnitude of the effects\\nof transverse shear and normal stress deformation .\\n  the results of this investigation indicate the necessity of\\ntaking account of transverse shear and normal stress in sandwich-type\\nshells, as soon as there is an order-of-magnitude difference between\\nthe elastic constants of the core layer and of the face layers of the\\ncomposite shell .  it was found that the changes due to transverse\\nshear and normal stress deformation in the core may be so large as to\\nbe no mere corrections to the results of the theory without transverse\\ncore flexibility .\\n  the actual magnitude of the changes is greatly dependent on the\\ngeometry and loading condition of the structure under consideration\\nso that no general rules may be given which indicate for which elastic\\nmodulus ratio the changes begin to be significant .\\n  solutions of problems in the present theory may in general be\\nobtained by mathematical methods which are similar to those employed\\nin the theory of plates and shells without the effect of transverse\\nshear and normal stress deformation included .  the present work does\\nnot include consideration of buckling and

nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thin\\nelastic shallow spherical shells .\\n  a shallow spherical dome subjected to lateral pressure is a structure\\nfor which the deformation departs appreciably from the linear theory at\\nrelatively small values of the deflection amplitude .  it is also one\\nfor which the buckling process is characterized by a rapid decrease in\\nthe equilibrium load once the buckling load has been surpassed .  for\\nstructures having this type of buckling characteristics the question\\narises as to whether the proper buckling criterion to apply is the\\nclassical criterion, which considers equilibrium with respect to\\ninfinitesimal displacements, or the finite-displacement /energy\\ncriterion/ proposed by tsien .\\n  in this paper the problem of the finite displacement and buckling\\nof a shallow spherical dome is investigated both theoretically and\\nexperimentally .  in the theoretical approach the nonlinear equations\\nare converted into a sequence of linear equations by expanding all of\\nthe variables in powers of the center deflection and then equating the\\ncoefficients of equal powers .  the basic parameter for the shallow dome\\nis proportional to the ratio of the central height of the dome h to its\\nthickness t .  for small values of this ratio the expansions converge\\nrapidly and enough terms are computed to determine the buckling load\\naccording to the classical criterion .  for higher values of h t,\\nconvergence deteriorates rapidly and it was not possible to determine the\\nbuckling load with the number of terms which were computed .  however\\neven for these higher values of h t the deflection shapes are determined\\nfor deflection amplitudes below the amplitude at which buckling occurs .\\nthese deflection shapes are characterized by their rapid change as h t\\nincreases and by the fact that, over most of the range of h t studied,\\nthe maximum deflection does not occur at the center of the dome .\\n  experimental results seem to indicate that the classical criterion\\nof buckling is applicable to very shallow spherical domes for which the\\ntheoretical calculation was made .  a transition to energy criterion for\\nhigher domes is also indicated .\\n.I 828\\n.T\\nstresses and small displacements of shallow spherical\\nshells .\\n.A\\nreissner,e.\\n.B\\nj. math. phys. 25,

such a manner that the ends remain circular without\\ndirectional restraint being imposed .  it is found that the complexity\\nof the mode of vibration bears little relation to the natural\\nfrequency,. for example, cylinders of very small thickness-diameter\\nratio, with length about equal to or less than the diameter, may have\\nmany of their higher frequencies associated with the simpler modes of\\nvibration .  the frequency equation which is derived by the energy\\nmethod is based on strain relations given by timoshenko .  in this\\napproach, displacement equations are

discussion . in order to obtain critical speeds for\\nthe model within the speed range of ordinary wind tunnels it is\\nnecessary that the model should differ in some respect from a mere small\\nsuggested by mckinnon wood the modification of the model consists in a\\nreduction of its effective stiffnesses . this method has the defect /in\\nmost cases probably not serious/ that the model experiment is conducted\\nat a reynolds number much below that for full-scale . in the present\\npaper it is pointed out that an alternative method of reducing the\\ncritical speed is to increase the mass loading of the model and to make\\nthe flutter tests in compressed air . * it is then quite feasible to\\nreach the full-scale reynolds number . this method of reducing the\\ncritical speeds by a proportionate increase of all effective densities\\nmay also be combined with a reduction of the elasticity of the model .\\nthe relation of model and full-scale stresses at the critical flutter\\nspeeds is considered . where the reduction in critical speed is effected\\n by increase of density only, the model and full-scale stresses are\\nequal . in a model of reduced elasticity the stresses in the wires are\\nthe same as for full-scale,  whereas, the stresses in the spars are less\\n than for full-scale . this is in accord with the usual experience that\\nthe wires of such a model are the first parts of the structure to fail\\nin a flutter .\\nlastly, the influence of gravity on flutter is considered . this is\\nnegligibly small for full-scale, but not

and proposed investigations into the flow\\nfor slender delta and other wings in unsteady motion .\\n  the practical need for research\\ninto the aerodynamics of\\nslender delta wings in unsteady motion has\\nbeen emphasized in a recent\\npaper by zbrozek .  two important aspects\\nare ..  -      formation and presence of\\n      leading-edge vortices .\\n      with oscillatory or transient\\n      modes of longitudinal (or\\n      chordwise) bending .\\n  the first of the aspects\\nabove, has already been briefly\\ndiscussed in ref. 2 .  one feature of\\nthe flow with leading-edge vortices\\nwhich seems to be of particular\\nsignificance to the dynamic behaviour\\nof a wing is the shedding of vorticity\\nat the leading edge as well as at\\nthe trailing edge .  any time-dependent\\nmotion, or distortion, of the wing\\nleads to a change in the rate at which\\nvorticity is shed .  with more\\nconventional types of flow, the free\\nvorticity being shed only from the\\ntrailing edge has diminishing influence\\non the wing, but when the free\\nvorticity is shed from the leading edge,\\nin passing downstream, it\\nremains close to the upper surface of the\\nwing .  it might be expected\\nthen, that, although the magnitudes of the\\nunsteady forces may not be\\ngreatly affected for a slender delta, the\\ntime delays associated with\\nthe forces may be significantly different\\nfor the attached and\\nseparated regimes of leading-edge flow .\\n.I 903\\n.T\\ntwo dimensional transonic unsteady flow with shock\\nwaves .\\n.A\\neckhaus,w.\\n.B\\nm.i.t.

situation being\\nsuch that local supersonic regions terminated by\\nshock-waves are present in the vicinity of the airfoil .  for\\nthe unsteady part of the flow, small perturbations\\ntechnique is employed and the interaction with the shock\\nwave is taken into account .  the case of an oscillating\\naileron is considered first, and a solution is derived\\nfor the pressure distribution on the aileron .  it is\\nfound that the solution has a simple form when the\\nshock-wave is well ahead of the hinge axis of the\\naileron .  as the shock approaches the hinge-axis a\\ncorrection must be added to the solution .  an\\ninterpretation of these results is given .  the results are\\ncompared with results of a theory which neglects the\\npresence of the shock and it is found that both agree\\nfor m = 1 .  for m   1, however, neglecting the presence\\nof the shock waves introduces errors of the order of\\nmagnitude (1 - m), where m is the local mach number\\nbehind the shock .\\n  the theory is finally extended to include the case\\nin which the whole airfoil oscillates, but only the\\nsolution for the subsonic region behind the shock is\\ntreated .  the role of the unsteady shock-boundary layer\\ninteraction is discussed and it is shown that this\\nmechanism can be included in the results of the present\\ntheory .\\n.I 904\\n.T\\ncalibration of the standard pitot-static

of the pressure\\ndistribution and the aerodynamic forces and\\nmoments on a wing performing harmonic\\npitching and heaving oscillations .\\nthe calculation is based on the\\nassumption of inviscid potential flow\\nwithout shock waves and is\\nrestricted to small incidence, so that the\\nlinearized theory is valid .\\n  in contrast to other work in the\\nfield the theory applies to all\\nmach numbers .  it is restricted to small\\nvalues of the reduced frequency\\nand should be valid for the usual range\\nof short periods occurring at\\npresent in flight .  the formal solution\\nyields two integral equations for\\nthe parts of the load, which are in phase\\nand go out of phase with the\\noscillation,. these are of the same form\\nas the corresponding equation\\nin steady flow .\\n  the way is thus opened for solutions\\nover the whole mach number\\nrange at small frequencies, if the\\ncorresponding steady solutions can\\nbe found .  the calculation is in fact\\neasiest for m = 1 and has been\\ndone here for delta-wings to supplement\\na previous supersonic calculation,\\nmade on different frequency assumptions,\\nwhich broke down near m = 1 .\\nit appears from the two sets of results\\nthat the short period oscillation\\nwill be unstable near m = 1, if the apex\\nangle of the delta wing is\\ngreater than about 60 .  this confirms a\\nnow generally recognised trend .\\n  such results near m = 1 must of\\ncourse be invalidated to an\\nunknown extent by thickness viscosity and\\nshock waves at their maximum\\neffect .  nevertheless it is unlikely that\\nthese factors

calculate--by means of the aforementioned\\nincompressible cross-flow potential--the local flow inclination\\nangles which are in good agreement with the measured values,\\nexcept in the vortex core, in the vicinity of the feeding sheet,\\nand in regions for which transonic cross-flow velocities are\\nexpected .  a consideration of these various regions with simple\\nmethods which account for the observed phenomena leads to\\nsubstantial improvement in the agreement between theory and\\nexperiment .\\n  it is indicated that the complete vortex wake flow may be\\nadequately predicted for a body

cylinders under\\naxial compression and bending .\\n  the results of experiments on axial loading of cylindrical\\nshells (thin enough to buckle below the elastic limit and\\ntoo short to buckle as euler columns) are not in good\\nagreement with previous theories, which have been based on the\\nassumptions of perfect initial shape and infinitesimal\\ndeflections .  experimental failure stresses range from 0.6\\nto 0.15 of the theoretical .  the discrepancy is apparently\\nconsiderably greater for brass and mild-steel specimens\\nthan for duralumin and increases with the radius-\\nthickness ratio .  there is an equally great discrepancy between\\nobserved and predicted shapes of buckling deflections .\\n  in this paper an approximate large-deflection theory is\\ndeveloped, which permits initial eccentricities or\\ndeviations from cylindrical shape to be considered .  true\\ninstability is, of course, impossible under such conditions,.\\nthe stress distribution is no longer uniform, and it is\\nassumed that final failure takes place when the maximum\\nstress reaches the yield point .  the effect of initial\\neccentricities and of large deflections is much greater than for\\nthe case of simple struts .  measurements of initial\\neccentricities in actual cylinders have not been made,.\\nhowever, it is shown that most of these discrepancies can be\\nexplained if the initial deviations from cylindrical form are\\nassumed to be resolved into a double harmonic series, and\\nif certain reasonable assumptions are made as to the\\nmagnitudes of these components of the deviations .  with\\nthese assumptions the failing stress is found to be a\\nfunction of the yield point as well as of the modulus of\\nelasticity and the radius-thickness ratio .  on the basis of this\\na tentative design formula (5) is proposel, which involves\\nrelations suggested by the theory but is based on\\nexperimental data .\\n  it is shown that similar discrepancies between\\nexperiments and previous theories on the buckling of thin\\ncylinders in pure bending can be reasonably explained on the\\nsame basis, and that the maximum bending stress can\\nbe taken as about 1.4 times the values given by equation\\nbuckling problems can probably be explained by similar\\nconsiderations, and it is hoped that this discussion may\\nhelp to open a new field in the study of buckling problems .\\nthe large-deflection theory developed in the paper should\\nbe useful in exploring this field, and may be used in other\\napplications as well .\\n  the paper presents the results of about a hundred new\\ntests of thin cylinders in axial compression and bending,\\nwhich, together with numerous tests by lundquist, form\\nthe experimental evidence for the conclusions arrived at .\\n.I 929\\n.T\\nstability of the cylindrical shell of variable curvature .\\n.A\\nmarguerre,k.\\n.B\\nnaca tm.1302,1951.\\n.W\\nstability of the cylindrical shell of variable curvature .\\nthe report is a first attempt to devise a calculation method\\nfor representing the buckling behavior of cylindrical shells\\nof variable curvature .  the problem occurs, for instance,

.\\n.A\\ncoleman,w.s.\\n.B\\nj. ae. scs. 1959, 264.\\n.W\\nthe characteristics of roughness from insects as observed\\nfor two-dimensional, incompressible flow past airfoils .\\n  advances in the practical development of boundary-layer\\ncontrol for the maintenance of extensive laminar flow have drawn\\nattention to the problem of surface roughness, due not only to\\nartificial irregularities such as rivet heads, lap joints, window\\npanels, etc., but also to the kind generated in flight from impact\\nwith insects .  this natural form of roughening, the effects of which\\nhave been noted, though not investigated previously, is the\\nsubject of the present paper .\\n  the phenomenon may be divided into two parts--namely,\\nand (2) its effect upon the stability of the laminar boundary\\nlayer .  wind-tunnel experiments with the fruit fly, drosophila,\\nand the common housefly for the investigation of both (1) and\\nairfoils are fully described .  the former problem has also been\\ntreated mathematically in a separate paper, not yet published,\\nagreement between theory and experiment being satisfactory in\\nall essentials .\\n  the characteristics of the roughness profile consist principally\\nof a pronounced peak near the leading edge, followed by an\\nextensive area of surface over which there is a much reduced and\\ngradually diminishing value of the excrescence height .  further,\\nit is shown that, if the severe leading-edge roughness, or its effect\\nupon the boundary layer, can be eliminated, then the\\ndown-stream roughness causes no disturbance to the passage of a\\nlaminar layer--i.e., the surface, though roughened, is aerodynamically\\nsmooth .  moreover, it appears that the conditions defining the\\nupstream boundary to this region of insignificant roughness are\\nfundamentally the same as those which determine the critical\\nstate for transition at an artificial disturbance of a three-\\ndimensional character .\\n.I

laminar\\nincompressible boundary layer, for arbitrary distribution of\\nmain stream velocity and of wall temperature, is obtained by\\nusing the energy equation in von mises's form, and approximating the\\ncoefficients in a manner which is most closely correct near the\\nsurface .  the heat transfer rate to a portion of surface of length l\\nbreadth is given as\\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, o its prandtl number,\\np its density, u its viscosity, r(x) is the skin friction,\\nand t(x) the excess of wall temperature over main stream temperature .\\na critical appraisement of the formula indicates that it should be very\\naccurate for large, but that for of order 0.7 (for most gases) the\\nconstant should be replaced by 0.73, when the error should not exceed\\nthis yields a formula for nusselt number in terms of the reynolds number\\nr and the mean square root of the skin friction coefficient c, in the\\ncase of uniform wall temperature .\\nhowever, for the boundary layer with uniform main stream, the\\noriginal formula is accurate to within 3 percent even for .  by\\nknown transformations an expression is deducted for heat\\ntransfer to a surface, with arbitrary temperature distribution\\nalong it, and with a uniform stream outside it at arbitrary\\nmach number (equation (42)) .  from this the temperature distribution\\nalong such a surface is deduced in the case (of importance at high mach\\nnumbers) when heat transfer to it is balanced entirely by radiation\\nfrom it .  this calculation, which includes the solution of a non-linear\\nintegral equation, gives higher temperatures near the nose,\\nand lower ones farther back (figure 2), than are found from a theory\\nwhich assumes the wall temperature uniform and averages the heat\\ntransfer balance .  this effect will be considerably mitigated\\nfor bodies of high thermal conductivity., the author is not\\nin a position to say whether or not it will be appreciable for\\nmetal projectiles .  but for stony meteorites at a certain stage\\nof their flight through the atmosphere it indicates that\\nmelting at the nose and re-solidification farther back may occur, for\\nwhich the shape and constitution of a few of them affords evidence .\\nan appendix shows how the method for approximating and solving\\nvon mises's

speeds .\\n  at reynolds numbers greater than about 5 x 10\\ncorresponding to altitudes below about 180,000 ft, the hot outer inviscid\\nwake behind the bow shock wave produced by a blunt-nosed\\nbody at hypersonic speeds is cooled mainly by turbulent diffusion\\nand conduction .  turbulence originates in the inner wake formed\\nby the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed from\\nthe body surface when the boundary layer separates from the\\nsurface .  as this turbulence spreads outward, it swallows\\nenthalpy or momentum defect originally contained in the outer\\ninviscid wake .  if the turbulence is locally similar--i.e., if it\\nbehaves at each station like a slice of a low-speed /self-similar/\\nwake--then the turbulent diffusivity grows from a low initial\\nvalue near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag of\\nthe body at about 300 body diameters downstream .  at flight\\nvelocities of the order of 9,000-10,000 ft per sec. the growth of the\\nturbulent inner wake predicted on the basis of locally similar\\nturbulence is in good agreement with shadowgraph measurements\\nof wake widths behind spheres obtained in ballistic ranges in the\\nregion from 200 to 4,000 body diameters downstream of the body .\\ntentatively, one concludes that the turbulence mechanism in the\\nwake with respect to a fixed observer is similar to the low-speed\\ncase, in spite of the large mean temperature gradients .\\n  in order to illustrate the behavior of an observable such as\\nelectron density in a turbulent wake behind a blunt body, the\\ntwo limiting cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and pure\\ndiffusion (zero electron-ion recombination rate) are calculated for\\nm = 22 at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 ft .  even for the\\ncase of thermodynamic equilibrium, the predicted turbulent\\nradar trail length is about 200 body diameters at l-band (1,300\\nmc) at 100,000-ft altitude and about 150 body diameters for\\nuhf (400 mc) at 200,000 ft .  one interesting result is that the\\nwidth of the plasma cylinder corresponding to the plasma\\nrequency at l-band remains virtually constant at about 3.5 body\\ndiameters in the range 30 150 at 100,000-ft altitude .\\nthese results are sufficiently encouraging that one can consider\\nincluding the effects of finite chemical and electron-ion\\nrecombination rates in the analysis in order to give a more complete\\npicture of the wake at hypersonic speeds .\\n.I 977\\n.T\\nconcerning some solutions of the boundary layer equations\\nin hydrodynamics

response to a unit triangle variation of surface\\ntemperature, together with essentially standard formulas for transient\\ntemperature and heat flow into thick walls . the method can be used\\nwithout knowledge of the mathematical tools of its development . the\\nmethod is particularly suitable for determining the wall temperature in\\none-dimensional thermal problems in aeronautics where there is a\\ncontinuous variation of the heat-transfer coefficient and adiabatic-wall\\ntemperature . the method also offers a convenient means for solving the\\ninverse problem of determining the heat-flow history when temperature\\nhistory is known .\\na series of diversified problems were solved by exact analysis as well\\nas by the new method . a comparison of the results shows the new\\nmethod to be accurate . the labor involved is very modest in\\nconsideration of the nature of the thick-wall temperature problem .\\nlimiting solutions for the /infinitely thick/ wall and for

mixed-flow impellers, viii - comparison of\\nexperimental results for three impellers with shroud redesigned by rapid\\napproximate method .\\nthree centrifugal impellers with parabolic, circular, and\\nskewed-parabolic blading were modified by a recently developed design procedure\\n to reduce the velocity gradients along the hub from inlet to outlet .\\nall original dimensions except the shroud contours were retained .\\nexperimental investigation showed that the modified impellers had better\\nperformance characteristics than the original impellers at all speeds\\ninvestigated, the greatest gains occurring at speeds of 1300 feet per\\nsecond and higher . these large gains probably resulted primarily from\\nmore favorable velocity gradients and from designing these impellers\\nfurther away from the condition necessary for eddy formation . the\\nmodified impellers were thus able to operate over a wider range of\\nweight flows at high speeds .\\nthe modified impellers were investigated over a range of equivalent\\nspeeds of 900 to 1500 feet per second and flow rates from maximum to the\\n point of incipient surge . at 1300 feet per second, the peak pressure\\nratio and maximum adiabatic temperature-rise efficiency for the\\nparabolic-bladed impeller were 3.07 and 0.825, respectively . for the same\\nconditions, the circular-bladed impeller and the skewed-parabolic-bladed\\n impeller had pressure ratios of 3.13 and 3.15 and efficiencies of 0.737\\n and 0.805, respectively . of the three, the parabolic-bladed impeller\\nhad the highest maximum efficiencies /0.854 to 0.800/ and the best\\nweight-flow range over the speed range tested . on the basis of the\\nparameters investigated, it appears that parabolic blading is superior\\nto

was\\nlaminar over the entire body in the jet-off condition, a very small flow\\n from the jet moved the point of transition forward to the vicinity of\\nthe 20-percent-body station . as the jet flow

 an experimental investigation was\\nmade (1) to evaluate previously\\npublished theoretical procedures for\\nthe prediction of stress\\ndistribution for cases of radially symmetric\\nabrupt change in wall thickness of\\nthin-walled cylinders subject to\\ninternal pressure and (2) to\\ninvestigate the significance of stresses\\nattributable to the presence of\\nthickness changes typical of design practice .\\none theory was adequate in\\nitself for solution of the case of continuous\\nmiddle surface,. use of the\\nsecond theoretical procedure was required\\nto determine the additional\\nstresses arising from discontinuous middle\\nsurfaces at the change in\\nthickness .\\n  comparisons were made between\\ntheoretical and experimental stress\\ndistributions for cases with continuous\\nmiddle and continuous inner\\nsurfaces for radially symmetric changes in\\nwall thickness of a cylinder\\nsubject to internal pressure for diameter\\nto larger wall thickness ratios\\nof 117 and 28 and for the case of a\\ncontinuous outer surface for a ratio\\nof 28 .  in all tests the ratio of wall\\nthicknesses at the change in wall\\nthickness was 0.4 .\\n  there was reasonably good correlation\\nbetween theoretical and\\nexperimental curves of stress distribution .\\non the basis of this\\ncorrelation, it was concluded that the applicable\\ntheories were valid .  it\\nwas shown that inclusion of the stresses\\narising from the condition of\\ndiscontinuous middle surfaces at a change\\nin thickness has an important\\neffect on stress distribution .\\n  in the case of a cylinder with a\\ncontinuous outer surface, the\\nmaximum mean effective stress was of sufficient\\nmagnitude to indicate that\\nthis geometry should be avoided in design\\nif possible .  the maximum\\nmean effective stress was not increased to\\na significant degree by the\\npresence of a change in wall thickness in\\nthe other cases .\\n.I 1040\\n.T\\non transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells .\\n.A\\n.B\\n.W\\non transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells .\\n  experimental measurements of pressures and heat-transfer\\nrates over three blunt afterbodies of small fineness ratio in fully\\nseparated wakes are presented .  the afterbodies are generally\\nsimilar in shape but have different stepdown heights from the end\\nof the forebody .\\n  tests were made by means of a new shroud technique over a\\nrange of reynolds numbers closely corresponding to typical\\nflight conditions at mach numbers on the order of 20, considering\\nmodels on the order of 5 ft. in diameter at about 120,000 ft.\\naltitude .  stagnation temperatures on the order of 1,300 r. to\\n  strictly speaking, the test flows correspond to prototype flows\\nwhich would be created by a forebody consisting of a sharp or\\nslightly blunted 54 half angle cone which turns cylindrical for a\\nshort distance and then connects with the afterbody .  judiciously\\ninterpreted, the results may be considered to have a somewhat\\nwider applicability for approximation purposes .  the results are\\npresented and compared with each other in terms of\\nnondimensional variables based on flow conditions at the end of the\\nforebody .\\n  the pressure distribution along an afterbody is seen to be\\nroughly uniform in each run .  for a given point on an afterbody,\\nthe ratio of pressure to the stagnation pressure at the forebody\\nend (or exit) decreases with increasing stagnation pressure or\\nreynolds number .  the present pressures and pressure-reynolds\\nnumber variations (fig. 8) are compared with values obtained\\nfrom chapman's mach 2 or 3 base-pressure data,. qualitative and\\nsome quantitative agreement is noted .  in the reynolds number\\nrange comparable to those of the present tests, chapman's exit\\nboundary layers were considered to be laminar .  an approximate\\ncheck of the heat-transfer rate at the forebody end in the present\\ntests also indicates a laminar rate .  no information was obtained\\nconcerning the possible transition of the free-mixing separated\\nboundary layer covering the wake .  an adverse pressure gradient\\non the cylindrical end of the forebody figs. 7(a) and 7(c) was\\nobserved .\\n  heat-transfer rates are seen to be roughly uniform over an\\nafterbody in each run, although some increase in the streamwise\\ndirection is noted .  the afterbody nusselt number (n) varies\\nwith the reynolds number (r evaluated at the forebody end)\\nroughly in the manner n r where generally (fig. 13) .\\n  heat rates on the rear faces of the afterbodies are almost\\ntwice the values on the sides .  the heat rates on the large-step\\nbody are higher than those on the body of zero stepdown height .\\n  in an addendum, it is shown that the prandtl-meyer expansion\\nangle of the flow leaving the afterbody increases with increasing\\ntest reynolds number, and that the corresponding local mach\\nnumber square increases linearly with reynolds number .  the\\neffect is to keep the local wake reynolds numbers virtually\\nconstant with increasing test reynolds number while the afterbody\\nheat rates increase sharply .  the expansion angle on the\\nafterbody of zero stepdown height is significantly smaller than on the\\nstepped down bodies,. this may affect the decreased heat rates on\\nthis body .\\n.I 1041\\n.T\\nanalysis of

galerkin, whose original papers are\\ninaccessible to the present writer .  his knowledge\\nof the method is derived from a description given in\\na paper by e. p. grossman .  grossman states\\nthat the method was given by galerkin in his treatise\\np. 897), and that applications to oscillation problems\\nwere first made by v. p. lyskov .  it is pointed\\nout by grossman that galerkin's process in applications\\nto mechanics leads to the same results as\\nlagrange's principle of virtual work, but employs a\\nspecial co-ordinate system .\\n  the method of galerkin belongs to the same general\\nclass as those of rayleigh and ritz, for it seeks\\nto obtain an approximate solution of a differential\\nequation with given boundary conditions by taking\\na function which satisfies these conditions exactly,\\nand proceeds to specialise the function in such a\\nmanner as to secure approximate satisfaction of the\\ndifferential equation .  the selected function is\\na linear combination of n independent functions, and\\nthe coefficients are determined by a process of\\nintegration .\\n  the galerkin process can be considered from two\\npoints of view, (a) simply as a means for the\\napproximate solution of differential equations, and\\ntreatment of problems concerning the statics and\\ndynamics of elastic and other deformable bodies .\\nthese two aspects are treated separately in parts 1\\nand 2 of the paper respectively, and will now\\nbe briefly discussed .\\nwhich satisfies the boundary conditions, in\\nthe differential equation be .  since the result should be\\nzero, is the error in the differential equation .\\nthen the galerkin process consists in choosing the n\\ncoefficients in the function in such a manner that\\nn distinct weighted means of the error, taken throughout\\na certain range of representation, shall all\\nbe zero .\\nas a generalised force, and the multipliers used\\nto weight the errors are the virtual displacements\\ncorresponding to increments of each of the generalised\\nco-ordinates in turn .  thus the vanishing of the\\nweighted mean is here interpreted as the vanishing\\nof the virtual work in the appropriate displacement .\\n  the degree of accuracy attaindd can be increased\\nindefinitely by increasing the number of\\nindependent functions employed, but this entails a great\\nincrease of labour .  however, when the functions\\nare well chosen, an excellent approximation can be\\nobtained by the use of a very small number, as is\\nsufficiently shown by the examples included in this

analytic investigation of laminar combustion\\nprocesses which are essentially two- or three-dimensional\\npresent some mathematical difficulties .  there are,\\nhowever, several examples of two-dimensional flame\\npropagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in\\ncomparison with that in the principal direction of flow .\\nsuch examples occur in the problem of flame quenching\\nby a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate,\\ncombustion in laminar mixing zones, etc .  in these cases\\nthe problem may be simplified by employing what is\\nknown in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer\\napproximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his\\ntreatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate .  physically it\\nconsists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is\\nsmall, the variations of flow properties along the direction\\nof main flow are small in comparison with those in a\\ndirection normal to the main flow .  the analytic\\ndescription of the problem simplifies accordingly .  the present\\nanalysis considers the ignition and combustion in the\\nlaminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas\\nstreams .  one stream consists of a cool combustible\\nmixture, the second is hot combustion products .  the two\\nstreams come into contact at a given point and a laminar\\nmixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is\\nmodified by viscosity, and the temperature and\\ncomposition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical\\nreaction .  the decomposition of the combustible stream\\nis assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with\\ntemperature dependence according to the arrhenius law .\\nfor a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature\\ndistribution, the questions to be answered are ..  (1) does\\nthe combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far\\ndownstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear\\nand what is the detailed process of development .  since\\nthe hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition\\nalways takes place at some point of the stream .  however,\\nwhen the temperature of the hot stream drops below a\\ncertain value, the distance required for ignition increases\\nso enormously that it essentially does not occur in a\\nphysical apparatus of finite dimension .  the complete\\ndevelopment of the laminar flame front is computed using\\nan approximation similar to the integral technique\\nintroduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .\\n.I 1073\\n.T\\na practical method for numerical evaluation of solutions\\nof

(a) even with initial imperfections the\\nincremental theory of plasticity considerably overestimates the\\nbuckling strength as compared with the deformation theory,\\nwhich is in substantially good

torispherical shells by the\\ncurrent edition of the asme code on unfired\\npressure vessels can lead to failure during\\nproof-testing of the vessel .  the purpose\\nof the present paper is to show in what\\nrespects the code fails to give accurate results .\\nas an illustrative example, a hypothetical\\npressure vessel with a torispherical head\\nhaving a diameter-thickness ratio of 440 was\\nselected .  the supports of the vessel were\\nconsidered to be either on the main cylinder\\nor around the torus .  the vessel was\\nsubjected to internal pressure and the elastic\\nstresses in it were determined rigorously and\\nby the code .  a comparison of the two\\nrevealed that the code predicted stresses in the\\nhead which were less than one half of those\\nactually occurring .  furthermore, the code\\ngave no indication of the presence of high\\ncompressive circumferential direct stresses\\nwhich exceeded 30,000 psi for practically\\nthe entire torus .  if the head had been\\nfabricated using a steel with a yield point of\\nwould have failed or undergone large\\ndeformations, whereas the code would have\\npredicted that it was safe .  the code's rules\\nfor torispherical heads are thus in need of\\nrevision for certain geometries .  the\\nimplications of the foregoing results are currently\\nbeing studied by the asme,. in the interim,\\nhowever, designers should exercise care in\\napplying the code to torispherical shells .\\n  it is also shown in the paper that the use\\nof the membrane state as a particular\\nsolution of the differential

tests\\ninvolved tuft surveys and slipstream dynamic-pressure measurements for\\nseveral tilt-wing vtol models .  a more extensive series of tests,\\nincluding some measurements of the erosion of gravel by the slipstream\\nand some measurements of the unsteady rolling, yawing, and pitching\\nmoments, was also made on one of the models operating in the hovering\\ncondition near the ground .\\nthe results of the flow studies indicated the presence of a stronger\\nand deeper slipstream flow along the center line of the aircraft, and to\\nsome extent along parallel planes between adjacent propellers (on one\\nwing), than to the side of the aircraft .  this effect is caused by an\\nintensification of the individual slipstreams as they meet at the planes\\nof flow symmetry .  the intensified flow along the center line of the\\naircraft is amplified by the presence of the fuselage and causes the\\ndynamic pressure to be greater in front of the aircraft than would be\\nexpected on the basis of the slipstream of the individual propellers .\\nin the erosion tests it was found that gravel, if sufficiently small,\\nwas rapidly eroded by the slipstream and that this gravel could be\\nthrown high into the air if it struck even very small fixed obstacles on\\nthe ground (obstacles with a height less than the diameter of the\\ngravel) .  results of the investigation of moment

general method has been developed, using the methods of kinetic\\ntheory, whereby the surface temperatures of bodies can be calculated for\\nsteady flight at any speed in a rarefied gas .  the particular solution\\nwas made for a flat plate., however, the calculations can be easily\\nextended to bodies of arbitrary shape .\\nit was found that the aerodynamic heating problem in the absence of\\nsolar radiation, that is, for the case of nocturnal flight, becomes of\\nnegligible importance at altitudes of 125 miles and higher and up to\\nsteady flight speeds of 36,000 feet per second .  the effect of solar\\nradiation, for the case of daytime flight, becomes increasingly\\nimportant as the flight altitude is increased .  at an altitude of 150\\nmiles and higher, solar radiation is the predominating factor that\\ndetermines skin temperature .  owing to the strong effect of solar\\nradiation on skin temperatures at high altitudes, the desirability of\\nnocturnal flight is indicated in order to minimize skin temperatures .\\nin order to maintain low skin temperatures, it was found that the\\nangle of inclination of the body with respect to the flight path should\\nbe kept as small as possible .  this may be accomplished in practice\\nby designing the body to be finely tapered and by flying the body at\\nsmall angles of attack .\\nit is pointed out that skin temperatures may be reduced by insuring\\nthermal contact between portions of the skin inclined at positive\\nand negative angles with respect to the flight path .  as much surface\\nas possible should be inclined at negative angles .  practically,\\nthis may be accomplished by boattailing the body .\\nin the event that an internal skin-cooling system is employed, it is\\nshown that the rate of internal cooling must be of the same order of\\nmagnitude or greater than the rate at which heat is lost naturally\\nby emitted radiation .  if the cooling rate is below the natural\\nradiation rate, cooling has little effect upon skin temperatures .\\nit is shown that, in the case of a missile designed to fly over a wide\\nrange of altitudes and speeds, it is desirable to make the emissivity\\nof the skin as high as possible .  this conclusion, however, is\\nbased upon a skin surface for which the emissivity is independent\\nof the wave length of the emitted and absorbed radiant energy .\\na possible method of reducing surface temperatures is indicated by\\nthe decrease in skin temperature which accompanies a decrease in\\nthermal accommodation coefficient .  this phenomenon may be\\nused to advantage if it is possible to decrease the accommodation\\ncoefficient by altering the surface characteristics of the skin .\\n.I 1148\\n.T\\nknudsen flow through a

this\\neffect is studied by means of small perturbation theory, assuming\\nviscosity to be negligible when perturbing a turbulent boundary layer . an\\napproximation for thin boundary layers leads to a modified boundary\\ncondition at the wall of the test section, expressing the normal\\nstreamline slope induced by changes in mass flow density and crossflow\\nwithin the boundary layer . this boundary condition is applied to the\\nlinearized equations of subsonic flow and to the non-linear transonic\\nequations at choking, the cases of plane and circular test sections only\\n being treated in detail .\\nthe results of linear theory show that all corrections except the\\nthree-dimensional angle-of-attack correction are considerably reduced by\\n the presence of the boundary layers at mach numbers greater than 0.9,\\nthe essential part of their influence being due to the change of mass\\nflow density with pressure . in the case of choking the analysis\\nindicates that the presence of boundary layers will increase the maximum\\nmodel size for which the flow can be interpreted as corresponding to\\nmach number one in free flight . finally, the technique of using\\nartificial thickening of the wall boundary layers for a reduction of wall\\ninterference is considered, though without reaching a definite\\nconclusion as to its value as compared to other techniques .\\n.I

of the radial load .  this results in the pertinent\\nexpressions for the other displacements and for the\\nbending moments and membrane forces .  the cases of radial\\nloading considered here and those which can be reduced to\\nit are (a) a load uniformly distributed within a rectangle,\\ntion, uniformly distributed over a short distance in the\\ncircumferential direction, (d) a moment in the\\ncircumferential direction, uniformly distributed over a short\\ndistance in the longitudinal direction .  for all these\\nloadings the load factors, which have to be used in the\\npertinent formulas for the displacements, bending\\nmoments, and membrane forces, are computed .  for the case\\nof tangential loading an eighth-order differential\\nequation is derived in terms of the radial displacement and the\\ntangential load .  using this equation, formulas for the\\ndisplacements, bending moments, and membrane forces for\\ntangential loading within a rectangle are found .\\n.I

angle of\\nattack is considered under the assumption that the pressure\\ncoefficient law is newton's impact law as modified by busemann in\\norder to include centripetal acceleration effects .  after the\\ncondition that the pressure coefficient be nonnegative is accounted\\nfor and after arbitrary conditions are imposed on, in addition\\nto the thickness and the length, the enclosed area and the moment\\nof inertia of the contour in the two-dimensional case and the\\nwetted area and the volume in the axisymmetric case, the\\nminimal problem is formulated as a problem of the mayer type and\\nsolved by the combined use of the euler-lagrange equations,\\nthe transversality condition, the erdmann-weierstrass corner\\ncondition, and the properties of the switching function .\\n  particular attention is devoted to the class of problems such\\nthat, among the four quantities being considered, two are\\nprescribed while the remaining are free .  for these problems, the\\nextremal arc is composed of two subarcs ..  one is characterized by\\na positive pressure coefficient and is called the regular shape,. the\\nother is characterized by a zero pressure coefficient and is called\\nthe free layer .  in this connection, the analysis shows the\\nexistence of two different types of solutions depending on whether the\\nthickness is given or free .\\n  if the thickness is given, the expression for the regular shape is\\na power law, and the transition from the regular shape to the free\\nlayer occurs in the second half of the body .  in the two-\\ndimensional case, the exponent of the power law is 1 if the length is given\\nif the enclosed area is given, and 3 if the moment of inertia\\nof the contour is given,. the transition point from the power\\nbody to the free layer is located at 50 percent of the length if the\\nlength is given, at 66 percent if the enclosed area is given, and at\\nthe axisymmetric case, the exponent of the power law is if\\nthe length is given, 1 if the wetted area is given, and if the\\nvolume is given,. the transition point from the power body to the\\nfree layer is located at 60 percent of the length if the length is\\ngiven, at 70 percent if the wetted area is given, and at 80 percent\\nif the volume is given .\\n  on the other hand, for problems where the thickness is free,\\nthe equation governing the regular shape is not that of a power\\nbody, and the point of transition to the free layer is located in the\\nfirst half of the body .  in the two-dimensional case, the\\ntransition point is at 28 percent of the length if the length and the\\nenclosed area are given, at 32 percent if the length and the moment\\nof inertia of the contour are given, and at 45 percent if the\\nenclosed area and the moment of inertia of the contour are given .\\nin the axisymmetric case, the transition point is located at 35\\npercent of the length if the length and the wetted area are given,\\nat 39 percent if the length and the volume are given, and at 46\\npercent if the wetted area and the volume are given .\\n  for all of the cases considered, analytical expressions are\\nobtained for the optimum shapes, the thickness ratios, and the drag\\ncoefficients .\\n.I 1202\\n.T\\nuniformly valid second-order solution for supersonic\\nflow over cruciform surfaces

supersonic flow over a\\ncruciform configuration consisting of two intersecting rectangular\\nwings of high aspect ratio .  the practical interest is in\\napplication to supersonic inlets, wing-body junctions and vehicle fins .\\nthe fundamental interest centers about identification and\\nadjustment of the severe local failures of the ordinary second-order\\ntheory .  for wings with discontinuous slopes, discontinuous\\npotentials occur across the planar shock and square-root\\nsingularities in the velocities occur at the intersection of these shocks\\nwith the cruciform surfaces .  the problem is simple enough so\\nthat these interesting features stand out clearly .\\n  a second-order solution uniformly valid to first order is\\nconstructed by adjustment of the ordinary second-order solution\\nobtained first .  the uniformly valid solution has two different\\nseries representations in the thickness parameter .  one is the\\nordinary second-order series in ascending integral powers of the\\nthickness parameter which is valid in the interior of the\\nvertex-centered undisturbed mach cone, and the other is a series\\ncontaining fractional powers which is valid adjacent to and upstream\\nof this mach cone .  the uniformly valid solution gives the\\ndetailed wave structure and shows a flow regime upstream of the\\nvertex-centered undisturbed mach cone not predicted by the\\nordinary theory .  the two solutions are otherwise identical .\\nthe wave structure consists of a pyramidal arrangement of planar\\nshocks adjacent to and upstream of the above cone, followed by\\nweaker oblique expansion fans and finally by two extremely\\nweak shocks coincident with the vertex-centered undisturbed\\nmach cone .  as an example of the above, detailed results are\\npresented for the case of two intersecting wedges .  application\\nof the techniques to other quasi-cylindrical problems is discussed .\\n.I 1203\\n.T\\nthe propagation of a nonuniform

cross-sectional area while\\nthe other is of varying cross-sectional area .  it is assumed that\\nthe flow in the nonuniform section in front of the shock is initially\\na uniform state and no perturbations (due to the area variations)\\nof this flow reach the shock until the area variation is encountered .\\nwhen the shock enters the nonuniform section, it is perturbed,\\nthe shock strength altered and the subsequent flow is\\nnonisentropic .  in addition to the perturbation due to the effect of the\\narea variations on the initially uniform upstream flow, there are\\ntwo further contributions--viz., a permanent perturbation\\ncaused directly by the area changes and a transient\\ndisturbance--which propagates with true sonic speed with respect to the flow\\nbehind the shock, due to reflections of the permanent\\nperturbation at the shock .  expressions for these various contributions are\\nobtained .  the results presented include as special cases\\npropagation of a nonuniform conventional gas dynamic shock into a\\nmoving nonconduction fluid and propagation of a nonuniform\\nhydromagnetic shock wave into a stationary fluid .\\n.I 1204\\n.T\\nexperimental

and referenced to the drag coefficient of a\\nsphere in the gasdynamics region, for a gamma of 1.4, of 0.92 .\\n  tunnel stagnation conditions of pressure, temperature, density,\\nand pressure drop

investigation of the effects of cooling on\\nboundary-layer transition on a 9-in. diameter hemisphere in\\nsimulated hypersonic flow is reported .  the newtonian pressure\\ndistribution was obtained by use of a shroud and boundary layer\\ncooling was achieved by internally cooling the model .  transition\\nwas detected with hot wires and with a pitot tube at the surface .\\nattained .\\n  transition was observed in the subsonic and near-sonic flow\\nregion at and upstream of n = 45 .  in this region the stagnation\\nreynolds number at which transition occurred when the surface\\nwas highly polished was only slightly affected by cooling within\\nthe temperature range .  thus, transition\\nreversal does not occur on a polished spherical surface within the\\nrange of these tests, and we therefore conclude that the cooling\\ndid not cause the linear stability of boundary layer to decrease\\nsignificantly .\\n  an essential feature of transition studies with boundary-layer\\ncooling is the close control of surface roughness .  in the present\\nexperiments this control required, in addition to a highly polished\\nsurface, the necessity for low water vapor dewpoint, the\\navoidance of carbon dioxide condensation and the utilzation of every\\navailable means for removing the dust from the airstream .\\n.I 1206\\n.T\\nmagnetohydrodynamic mach cones .\\n.A\\ncumberbatch,e.\\n.B\\nj. ae. scs. 1962, 1476.\\n.W\\nmagnetohydrodynamic mach cones .\\n  features of the surfaces of main disturbance created by a small\\nobject in steady motion through a

relating to the downwash\\nimpingement problem are examined in order to arrive at a\\ncoherent understanding of the process of entrainment of ground\\nparticles in the flow .  it is demonstrated that a key mechanism\\nin the process is the interaction of nonuniform flow in the ground\\nboundary layer with bluff ground particles .  this interaction\\nproduces a lift force which, under typical conditions, equals or\\nexceeds the particle weight .\\n  in the interest of quantitative prediction of the conditions\\nnecessary for particle entrainment, four subsidiary problem areas\\nin the impinging jet are examined .  these are the viscous decay,\\nthe inviscid flow field, the ground boundary layer, and the forces\\non a bluff body in nonuniform flow .  applicable theories are\\nused in conjunction with experimental data to assess the accuracy\\nand range of validity of the theories, and to define the stream\\nconditions which will cause particle entrainment .\\n  available data are applied to the establishment of criteria for\\nparticle entrainment in the vicinity of the impinging-jet\\nstagnation point .  these criteria show that entrainment occurs in a\\nfinite annular region on the ground plane, and that the particles\\nmost readily entrained are those with a diameter equal to about\\ntwo-thirds the thickness of the ground boundary layer .  the\\nconfiguration size is shown to influence the process in that the\\nonset of entrainment is fixed by the jet diameter and velocity,\\nand the size of the ground particles .  the criteria established\\nprovide a quantitative estimate of the conditions causing\\nentrainment and provide a basis for scaling experimental results to\\na variety of full-scale situations .\\n.I 1210\\n.T\\non slender airfoil theory

varied from\\nabout 3 x 10 to 8 x 10 .  some data were also obtained at a\\nmach number of 0.70 .\\n  at speeds up to a mach number of 5 and for roughness sizes\\nsuch that the quadratic resistance

the sound-\\nemitting small-scale turbulent eddies (with frequencies much higher\\nthan those of large-scale eddies), the laminar shear layer has an\\nirregular contour, as if the large-scale

by approximating portions of the kernels of the\\ntransformed integral equation by single and double fourier series and\\nperforming termwise integrations analytically .  this is followed\\nby the routine inversion of the aerodynamic influence coefficient\\nmatrix, after satisfying appropriate boundary conditions at\\nselected control points .  in this procedure the number of control\\npoint

 the whitham theory predicting the far-flow field around a\\nprojectile is used to derive body shapes which produce extreme\\nbow shock-wave pressure jump or /boom,/ subject to\\nconstraining conditions regarding the drag due to the bow shock and\\nfineness ratio of the bodies .  it is found that the minimum drag\\nbody is also the minimum boom body .  the body-volume effect\\nand the effect of discontinuities in slope of the body meridian\\nsection on the boom intensity is investigated .\\n  as a general result of the investigation, it can be said that the\\nboom of a projectile for given mach number and flight altitude\\nis primarily determined by its length and fineness ratio .  the\\nmaximum variation in the boom intensity for pointed bodies\\nwith given length and

.\\n.A\\nwaldman,g.d. and probstein,r.f.\\n.B\\nj. ae. scs. 1961, 119.\\n.W\\nan analytic extension of the shock-expansion method .\\n  the problem is considered of calculating approximately the\\ninviscid rotational flow field and pressure distribution about a\\nsmooth two-dimensional airfoil with sharp leading and trailing\\nedges in a uniform supersonic or hypersonic stream .  the\\nassumption of a perfect gas is made, and the basic flow pattern for\\nthe analysis is taken to be given by the simple isentropic\\nshock-expansion method with straight characteristics .  an elementary\\ncharacteristics treatment is discussed to show when the simple\\nshock-expansion method should be satisfactory for computing\\nthe surface pressure distribution, and under what circumstances\\nit may be expected to break down .  by utilizing characteristic\\nvariables the isentropic shock-expansion method is then\\nformulated analytically, and an analytic result is obtained for the shock\\nshape corresponding to this zero-order approximation .  in the\\nspecial case where hypersonic similitude is applicable, that is,\\nfor slender bodies and high mach numbers, the shock-shape\\nexpression for large distances is found to reduce to the result\\npreviously given by mahony, which for weak shocks and slender\\nbodies in turn reduces to the simple-wave result first given by\\nfriedrichs .\\n  employing the analytic form of the isentropic shock-expansion\\nmethod as a zero-order approximation, an analytically consistent\\nperturbation method is developed by expanding the dependent\\nflow variables in the exact partial differential equations in powers\\nof the reflection coefficient for simple waves interacting with an\\noblique shock .  the scheme by its nature helps to define those\\nregions in which shock expansion can be used, in addition to\\ntaking into account in a perturbation sense the factors neglected\\nin simple shock-expansion theory, namely, the curvature and\\nreflection of the mach waves and the correct boundary\\nconditions at the shock wave .  analytic solutions are obtained for\\nthe first-order corrections, including the surface pressure\\ndistribution .  the necessary numerical computation of the integrals\\ninvolved is considerably simpler than a direct application of the\\nmethod of characteristics .  to illustrate the method and its\\naccuracy, the zero-order shock shape and first-order pressure\\ndistribution are calculated for a family of parabolic arc airfoils at\\nan infinite free-stream mach number .  these results are\\ncompared with rotational characteristic solutions where available,\\nand the present method is found to be in excellent agreement .\\n.I 1249\\n.T\\nplasma flow over a thin charged

symmetric corner with varying angle\\nand streamwise pressure gradient .  it represents an extension\\nand modification of the constant density analysis of loitsianskii\\nand bolshakov .  the analysis is applied to the case of constant\\npressure, constant corner angle, and isothermal surfaces, for\\nwhich the crocco velocity-enthalpy relation holds .  although\\nsimplifying assumptions limit the quantitative accuracy outside\\nthe 60 to 120 angle range, some qualitative trends are\\nprobably correct outside this range .  the limiting cases near 0\\nand 180 are not considered .\\n  favorable agreement between some results obtained by the\\nintegral method and by other methods is demonstrated for the\\nisothermal, constant-density case .\\n  results show an increasingly sharp merger of the outermost\\nisovels of streamwise velocity as the mach number increases .\\nthis sharp merging of the outer isovels is increased by increasing\\ncorner angle and by insulation of heating of the surfaces .  within\\nthe interior of the viscous layer the spreading or contraction of\\nthe disturbed region of merging is influenced by surface\\nheat-transfer conditions .  surface shear and heat flux are decreased\\nin the disturbed region, and are zero at the apex .  for cases\\ncorresponding roughly to the higher mach numbers of wider\\ncorner angles, the /specific momentum-area/ exhibits the same\\ndecrease with mach number as its two-dimensional counterpart,\\nwhereas the /specific displacement-area,/ a measure of\\nstream-tube dilation, increases more rapidly with mach number

undisturbed\\ndirection of the stream .  it is assumed that the kinematic\\nviscosity is small .  the first approximation is taken to be the\\nundisturbed motion, and successive approximations are obtained\\nby iferation .  the second approximation is the blasius shear\\nlayer necessary to satisfy the boundary conditions on the plate .\\nin turn, this layer leads to a velocity component normal to the\\nplate which needs a potential solution, in which the velocities\\nare 0, to match with the conditions at infinity .  further,\\nthe match at the edge of the blasius shear layer must

degrees of freedom are\\nfrozen out can exceed the degree of dissociation, and hence the\\ndensity, for the case where all degrees of freedom are in\\nequilibrium .  thus the necessary condition for a maximum of the\\ndensity between the shock front and the position of full\\nequilibrium flow downstream of the shock front is established .  the\\nsufficient condition that such a maximum be observable is shown\\nto be that the approach to equilibrium of the vibrational degrees\\nof freedom (or any other internal degrees of freedom) must lag\\nthe approach to dissociation equilibrium by a significant amount,.\\nthat is, there must be at least an order of magnitude difference in\\nthe respective relaxation times before such a maximum might be\\nobserved .  an example calculation for a

the\\nsimplicity of algebraic equations coupled with the use of charts\\nrather than the laborious simultaneous solution of coupled\\ndifferential equations required by existing methods .  the method also\\naffords, for the first time, a means of determining the total\\nboundary-layer thickness, thus allowing calculation of the absolute as\\nwell as the nondimensional velocity distribution .\\nthe

in\\nheated boundary layers may be achieved by either of two\\nconceptual mechanisms .  in one mechanism it is pictured that the heat\\ntransfer to the wall quenches the propagating flame at a certain\\ndistance from the surface .  the equality between the flow velocity\\nand the normal burning velocity at this quenching distance\\ndetermines the position of the propagating flame .  in the second\\nmechanism it is conceived that the hot surface provides a\\ncontinuous source of ignition in much the same manner that the hot\\nrecirculation zone of a bluff body flame holder provides continuous\\nignition to the gas flowing around it .  in this case it is the\\ncharacteristic time during which the gas must be heated that determines\\nthe position of the flame .\\n  all experimental work reported to date has been concerned with\\nconditions where the first picture has apparently been applicable .\\nin the present paper, experiment and analysis are given that show\\nunder what conditions the continuous ignition mechanism provides\\nthe appropriate model and also how the two models are related .\\nto differentiate the two mechanisms an experiment was set up

represented by a surface distribution of\\nappropriate /modified/ sources in a fashion similar to ordinary\\nsupersonic thin-wing theory .  these sources are found by\\napproximating the exact potential for a constant-strength\\ncompressible source traveling along a helical path .  the usual\\nrelationship between the source strength and boundary condition is\\nfound,. and subsequently the source distribution is given, to the\\nappropriate order, in terms of the blade geometry .\\n  tip effects are considered by extending the theory of evvard\\nand krasilshchikova .  the present investigation, however, is\\nrestricted to those planforms for which no vortex sheet appears\\noff the tip .  for points in the tip region, the potential is obtained\\nthrough the appropriate distribution of /modified/ sources in the\\nupwash region off the tip .  by transforming to a curvilinear,\\nnonorthogonal coordinate system coincident with the modified mach\\nlines described by the infinities of the potential, an integral\\nequation for the required source distribution in the upwash region is\\nderived .  without having to solve this equation, it is shown that\\nthe potential

of a vortex by means of another concentric\\nvortex of equal strength but opposite spin is investigated .  when\\nsuch a cancellation occurs, there is a recovery of static pressure .\\nthe vortices are generated by means of two three-dimensional\\nairfoils cantilevered from the duct wall, one being situated in the\\nwake of the other .  the airfoils have opposite effective angles of\\nattack and therefore have trailing vortices of opposite spin, as\\nrequired .\\n  it is demonstrated experimentally that there exists an optimum\\nangle of attack for the second airfoil which cancels the vortex\\nfrom the first airfoil and restores uniform flow downstream of\\nthe two airfoils .  a theoretical solution of this optimum angle of\\nattack is presented, and it is found to depend upon the angle of\\nattack of the first airfoil and upon the geometrical properties of\\nthe wings .  the pressure recovery accompanying the vortex\\ncancellation is also studied .  theoretical considerations, based on\\nthe model of a vortex filament in the center of a circular tube\\nshow that a maximum of 62 per cent of the static pressure drop\\nacross the first airfoil can be recovered .  this maximum is\\nimposed, irrespective of skin friction and separation losses, by the\\nirreversibility associated with establishing a vortex field .\\nexperimental pressure recoveries of 50 per cent are realized

knowledge of the response of materials subjected to a\\nsevere aerothermal environment is essential in the space age .\\nthe successful design of space and re-entry vehicles demands\\nthat the

produce\\nminimum drag, the given lift must be distributed over the wing\\nsurface in such a way that the sum of the downwash induced by\\nthis distribution and the downwash induced in reversed flow is\\nconstant over the wing surface .  this combined downwash can be\\nexpressed by an integral which contains the load as a function\\nof the spanwise and chordwise coordinate .  the problem of\\nfinding the appropriate load distribution is thus reduced to the\\nproblem of finding the solution of a rather cumbersome integral\\nequation .\\n  the severe spanwise singularity of the kernel function is\\nhandled most easily, as in corresponding subsonic problems, by an\\napproximate integration over interpolation polynomials .  the\\nchordwise load distribution is represented by a limited series\\ndevelopment in legendre polynomials .  the sigularity of the\\nkernel function along the mach lines through any pivotal point\\ncan be avoided by a similar legendre development of the\\ncombined induced downwash which is constant .  the integral\\nequation is thus converted into a system of linear equations for the\\nunknown coefficients of the legendre functions of the load\\ndistribution at a limited number of spanwise stations .\\n  practical calculations are carried out on an electronic\\ncomputer .  the solutions yield the optimum load distribution and the\\nlocal incidence (twist, camber, etc.) necessary to realize this\\ndistribution .  for many wing plan forms, considerable gains\\nover a plane wing appear possible .\\n.I 1281\\n.T\\nturbulent

1957.\\n.W\\nsome effects of bluntness on boundary layer transition\\nand heat transfer at supersonic speeds .\\n  large downstream movements of transition observed when the\\nleading edge of a hollow cylinder or a flat plate is slightly\\nblunted are explained in terms of the reduction in reynolds\\nnumber at the outer edge of the boundary layer due to the\\ndetached shock wave .  the magnitude of this reduction is\\ncomputed for cones and wedges for mach numbers to 20 .\\nconcurrent changes in outer-edge mach number and temperature occur\\nin the direction that would increase the stability of the laminar\\nboundary layer .\\n  the hypothesis is made that transition reynolds number is\\nsubstantially unchanged when a sharp leading edge or tip is\\nblunted .  this hypothesis leads to the conclusion that the\\ndownstream movement of transition is inversely proportional to\\nthe ratio of surface reynolds number with blunted tip or\\nleading edge to surface reynolds number with sharp tip or leading\\nedge .  this conclusion is in good agreement with the\\nhollow-cylinder result at mach 3.1 .\\n  application of this hypothesis to other mach numbers yields\\nthe result that blunting the

described mathematically by the same equations which are also\\napplied to the processes in the laminar boundary layer in the\\ntwo-dimensional flow along a body contour, the form of which is\\ndetermined by the shape of the body of revolution .  a simple\\nrelation exists between the two-dimensional boundary layers and\\nthe axially symmetrical ones .  the flow had been assumed to be\\nincompressible .  in this report it shall be shown that this\\nrelation is still valid when the compressibility is taken into\\nconsideration .  the distribution of velocity as well as that

performance of a shock tunnel operated by the reflected-shock\\ntechnique is examined theoretically neglecting viscous effects and\\nhigh-temperature real-gas effects . particular attention is given to\\ndisturbances to the flow at the nozzle entry caused by waves reflected from\\n the contact surface when the operating conditions depart from those for\\nthat the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is weak\\nenough to be tolerated only within a small range of primary-shock mach\\nnumber, m /e.g., 5 7 m 6 3 if the pressure at entry to the nozzle is to\\nremain constant to 10 per cent/ . within this range, running times much\\nlonger than those obtained in 'straight-through' shock tunnels are\\npredicted, the limitation usually being imposed by the arrival of the\\nexpansion wave originating at the diaphragm .\\noutside this range of mach number, the uniform-flow duration between the\\n arrival at the nozzle entry of the primary shock and the first\\ndisturbance reflected from the contact surface is shown to be approximately\\n equal to the time between the arrival of the primary shock and the\\ncontact surface in a 'straight-through' shock tunnel . at first sight it\\n appears, therefore, that the advantages of reflected-shock operation\\nare confined to a very narrow range of shock mach number, unless a\\nheated driver gas is used in order to vary the mach number for\\nfurther analysis suggests, however, that subsequent disturbances in the\\nmultiple wave reflection process between the contact surface and the end\\n of the tube are relatively weak over a useful range of shock mach\\nnumber . thus, if the flow after the arrival of the early reflected\\ndisturbances is used for test purposes, long running times seem possible in\\n theory without severe restrictions to the shock mach number .\\nexperiments have been made in a shock tube and a shock tunnel to\\nprovide data for comparisons with the results of the simple theory . if\\nallowance is made for viscous effects on the motion of the contact\\nsurface, fair agreement is found for the disturbances reflected and\\ntransmitted by the contact surface, and for the arrival of the expansion wave\\nreflection process increases when the shock mach number is raised\\nsubstantially above the 'tailored' value, and a limit to the usable flow\\nduration may result .\\na striking feature of the results is a fall of pressure at the end of\\nthe tube immediately after reflection of the primary shock . this is\\nattributed to attenuation of the reflected shock resulting from its\\ninteraction with the boundary layer on the wall of the tube . further\\nresearch is required to check this explanation, and to investigate the\\neffects of reynolds number and of the cross-sectional shape and size of\\nthe tube . the effects of the tail and reflected head of the expansion\\nwave originating at the main diaphragm are discussed . it is shown that\\nthe arrival of the reflected head at the nozzle entry may impose a\\nsevere limitation to the duration of uniform conditions at low shock\\nmach number, and that the arrival of the tail may limit the flow\\nduration at high shock mach number . unless means can be devised to\\nsuppress the expansion wave, it is demonstrated that it is desirable to\\nhave alternative diaphragm positions in a tube required to operate over\\na range of shock mach number .\\nit is concluded that running times of order 10 milliseconds at a shock\\nmach number of 4, falling to, perhaps, 1 millisecond at a shock mach\\nnumber of 8 seem possible in a shock tunnel of reasonable size by using\\nreflected-shock operation with unheated hydrogen driving air . because\\nof the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical investigations, and\\nthe deficiencies of the apparatus used for the experiments, the present\\ninvestigation must, however, be regarded as preliminary in character .\\nfurther research is required to check and extend the findings, and\\ntopics particularly requiring investigation are listed in the paper .\\n.I 1314\\n.T\\nproduction of high temperature gases in shock tubes

assumptions are made that ..  (a) the spanwise form of\\nthe structural distortion is known, leaving the chordwise\\ndistortion arbitrary,. and (b) the aerodynamic forces are\\napproximations of the supersonic linearized theory .  the form of the\\nchordwise distortion is then deduced from the differential\\nequation representing the state of neutral equilibrium for small\\ndisplacements at the critical divergence speed .\\n  secondly, this problem is investigated using measured\\nstructural flexibility coefficients together with theoretical\\naerodynamic coefficients .\\n  thirdly, the usual series solution based on the

homogeneous elastic medium, and various approximate\\nanalytical solutions obtained for certain types of surface, so as to reveal at\\nleast qualitatively the origin and characteristics of neutral\\noscillations . in the worked solutions the elastic medium is treated as\\nnondissipative, and the interior boundary is supposed either fixed, or free\\n of stress, or exposed to fluid .. the boundary layer, also, is treated\\nas that over a flat-plate in an incompressible fluid .\\nthe results obtained show that the presence of such a resiliant surface\\nintroduces the possibility of a number of other modes of oscillation\\nschlichting waves . most of these modes have speeds of propagation\\ndetermined largely by the properties of the elastic material, and their\\npresence may well be effectively a matter of 'non-viscous' flow\\nstability -dash a subject not treated here . the tollmien-schlichting\\nmode has its minimum reynolds number increased by the presence of the\\nsurface, but if the interior boundary is free there may be an upper\\nlimit as well . indeed, a sufficiently thin free surface, or one of low\\nrigidity, apparently eliminates neutral oscillations of this

object of the report is to establish a routine method for the\\ncalculation of aerodynamic loads on wings of arbitrary shape . the method\\ndeveloped is based on potential theory and uses a general mathematical\\nformula for continuous loading on a wing which is equivalent to a double\\n fourier series with unknown coefficients . in order to evaluate the\\nunknown coefficients the continuous loading is split up into a regular\\npattern of horseshoe vortices, the strengths of which are proportional\\nto the unknown coefficients and to standard factors which are given in a\\n table . the

waves and\\n boundary layers .\\nan account is given of an investigation into the interaction between the\\n boundary layer on a flat plate and a shock wave produced either\\nexternally, by a wedge in the supersonic mainstream, or from within the\\nboundary layer, by a wedge held in contact with the plate . a wide range\\n of free-stream mach numbers, boundary-layer reynolds numbers, and shock\\n strengths has been covered, shock strength being defined as the ratio\\nof the static pressure downstream of the shock to the static pressure\\nupstream of it . variations in these parameters can have large effects\\non the interaction, and there are also large differences between cases\\nwith externally generated shocks and cases where the shock is generated\\nfrom within the boundary layer . the investigation has thrown light on\\nthe physical mechanisms involved . it is found that many of the major\\nfeatures of the interaction arise because the boundary layer separates\\nfrom the surface ahead of the shock wave . the conditions under which\\nseparation occurs and the behaviour of the separated boundary layer thus\\n have important effects, in terms of which, for example, the differences\\n between the interactions observed with laminar and with turbulent\\nboundary layers may be explained .\\n.I 1365\\n.T\\napproximate calculation of the laminar boundary layer

defined by\\nbeing the\\nvelocity-component in the x direction and u the value of u at the\\nedge of the boundary-layer and and the displacement\\nand momentum thickness, respectively .  based on this\\ndiscovery, an approximate method is proposed by constructing\\ntwo universal curves l(m) and h(m) for all conceivable\\nboundary-layer flows found in practice .  once these are\\nchosen, karman's momentum-integral can be written in the\\nform, v being the kinematic\\nviscosity coefficient, and can be integrated numerically .  as\\nexamples, both howarth's and hartree's\\ntained is

of nearly equal velocity,\\nperformed with the usual assumptions for eddy viscosity and\\nprandtl number equal to a constant, shows that mixing will\\ntake place very slowly, i.e., at the rate corresponding to\\nlaminar diffusion .  it has been suggested that the difference\\nbetween analysis and experiment could be attributed to the\\npresence of a boundary layer in the experiments .  it is the\\npurpose of this note to show that the use of the classical\\neddy-viscosity law, admitting the existence of a boundary layer,\\nis not sufficient to explain the rapid mixing that is observed\\nphysically .  instead, it is shown that rapid mixing can be\\nexplained on the basis of a different eddy-viscosity law, as\\nwas suggested in ref. 1 .  these conclusions are

drag in free-molecule flow and its minimization .\\n  the superaerodynamic nose drag of a body in a free-molecule\\nflow involves two parameters ..  the speed ratio s between\\nordered and random molecular motions (modified mach\\nnumber), and the temperature ratio between the solid surface\\nand undisturbed gas .  simplifications of the drag formula are\\nobtained at hypersonic as well as low-subsonic extremes .  to\\nminimize the drag on a nose of specified length and base radius,\\nthe ordinary method of calculus of variation was found\\ninadequate .  a generalized approach has, accordingly, been developed,\\nand the specification of end conditions is discussed at length .\\n  results of the present investigation indicate that in all cases\\nan optimum nose requires a flat tip .  the optimum nose curve\\nfor the hypersonic extreme does not depend on the temperature\\nratio, but that for the low-subsonic extreme varies in the\\nfollowing manner ..  for a hot body the curve is convex,. for a cold body,\\nconcave .  an optimum solution exists in a restricted range of\\nspecification only .  with prescribed tip and base radii the\\nadmissible nose length is bounded below for the cases of hypersonic\\nand low-subsonic hot body and bounded above for the case of\\nlow-subsonic cold body .  a vanishing tip radius leads to an\\ninfinitely long nose in the former and a vanishing nose in the latter\\ncase .\\n  optimum nose curves for several temperature ratios at the\\nlow-subsonic extreme, as well as the one for hypersonic extreme, are\\npresented .  it is observed that at the low-subsonic extreme, with,\\nthe hot-body solution asymptotically approaches\\nthe hypersonic solution--i.e., a slender conventional warhead\\nwith a flat tip,. whereas with, the cold-body solution\\nasymptotically approaches the minimal-surface solution--i.e.,\\ntip radius, a flat disc .\\n.I 1374\\n.T\\ntheoretical analysis of turbulent mixing of reactive\\ngases with

possible to make the\\nassumption of flow similarity .  the solution in these cases can be\\nobtained either by laborious finite difference techniques or by\\nresort to approximate solutions .  carrier and lewis (1), and more\\nrecently carrier (2), have suggested a method of obtaining approximate\\nsolutions to problems involving convection and diffusion .  this\\nmethod, termed by carrier /the modified-oseen method/, overcomes an\\nessential difficulty of integral methods, namely, the generation of\\nreasonable profiles .  it is well known that the integral method gives\\naccurate results only if the analytical profiles represent closely\\nthe true profiles .  according to the modified-oseen method the\\nconvective operator in the original partial differential equation\\nis replaced by a linear one .  the resulting equation for the\\nboundary layer problem is the heat conduction equation which can be\\ntreated by well-known techniques .\\nit is the purpose of this paper to indicate a modification of this\\nprocedure and to demonstrate its simplicity and accuracy by treating the\\naxisymmetric laminar flow of a compressible gas with arbitrary but\\nconstant external flow .  the modification is based on the use of the\\nvon mises transformation with a subsequent linearization of the viscous\\nterm, rather than the linearization of the convective term .

completed\\nairplane represents .  at subsonic speeds, lift-drag\\nratios of well over 200 have been measured in wind\\ntunnels on airfoil sections., but few powered aircraft\\nhave attained (lift to drag ratio) value of 20 .  it is invariably true\\nthat the requirements of stability and control, structure,\\nand flight operation all contribute to reducing the\\ndesign (lift to drag ratio) considerably below those exotic values\\nwhich can be predicted from unrestricted aerodynamic\\ntheory .  if, however, a certain range or operating\\nefficiency is required, there is most certainly a minimum\\nif we examine the range equation we see that range is\\nproportional to the lift-drag ratio, the thermopropulsive\\nefficiency, and the logarithm of the initial to final\\nweight ratio .  the appearance of the lift-drag ratio as a\\nlinear factor in the range equation indicates that every\\nattempt should be made to increase (lift to drag ratio)., however,\\nthe search for higher (lift to drag ratio) may lead to strange\\nand unorthodox configurations .  most frequently, such\\nconfigurations are ruled out by the adverse effects of\\ntheir geometry on the weight ratios .  in the

four edges\\nare simply supported .\\n  the method of solution developed in this report is of very\\ngeneral application, and can be used to investigate the\\nstability of rectangular panels when the loading is any combination\\nof shear and compression or tension, and the edges\\nare clamped or simply supported, and not necessarily all clamped\\nor all simply supported .  by an easy extension the\\nmethod of solution can also be used to find the periods of transverse\\nvibration of rectangular panels for the same types\\nof loading and edge fixing .\\n.I 1388\\n.T\\na process for the

a new method for solving the problem\\nof the detached shock wave .  if the shock wave is assumed\\nknown, a cauchy problem for a system of partial differential\\nequations arises .  this has been solved by several authors\\nin the region where the system is elliptic (near the peak of\\nthe shock wave) .  considering the plane stationary case, the\\nauthor seeks an analytic continuation of the propagation\\nfunction (x,y) in the complex plane y = y1 + y2, x real .\\nin the plane (x, y2) the propagation function satisfies a\\nhyperbolic equation (near the peak of the shock wave) .  a\\nnew cauchy problem is solved and the solution of the original\\nproblem obtained by analytic continuation .  a numerical\\nexample is treated with many details .\\n.I 1390\\n.T\\non the numerical

shock\\nwaves in hypersonic flow .\\n  a method is described for calculating examples of hypersonic\\nflow with a detached bow shock wave past a bluff axially\\nsymmetric body .  the form of the shock wave is assumed, and the\\nanalysis is based on a cauchy problem for the stream function\\nin the subsonic region, where the motion is governed by a\\npartial differential equation of elliptic type .  through analytic\\ncontinuation into the complex domain, the cauchy problem is\\nreformulated in such a manner that it becomes properly set in the\\nsubsonic region .  this leads to a stable scheme for computation\\nof the flow by finite differences .  numerical examples at\\nfreestream mach number 5.8 are presented in which the flow is\\ndetermined throughout the subsonic region, and, in particular, the\\ndetachment distance, the location of the sonic line, and the\\npressure distribution along the body are calculated .  these results are\\nin excellent agreement with experimental

.\\n.W\\nshock wave and flow field development in hypersonic re-entry .\\na study is made of when and how a shock wave and continuum-type flow\\nfield develop in the nose region of a highly cooled blunt body re-\\nentering the atmosphere at hypersonic speed and in a free molecular flow\\nregime . the various types of flow regimes encountered down to low\\naltitude conditions are delineated, and the nature of the flow field and\\nbehavior of some of the aerodynamic characteristics are discussed . it\\nis shown that for a highly cooled body, free molecule flow conditions\\noccur at a higher altitude than previously indicated . based on\\navailable evidence, it is suggested that kinetic theory solutions, which are\\nessentially modified free molecule results, along with the navier-stokes\\n equations with no surface slip, serve to define all of the flow regimes\\n except for a narrow transitional layer regime which has a height of\\nless than one factor of 10 in free stream density change . it is also\\nsuggested that the appearance of a definable shock wave occurs very\\nrapidly in terms of density change near the beginning of the\\ntransitional layer regime, and that its location, as in continuum flow, is\\ngoverned principally by the body geometry, whereas its thickness is\\ndetermined by a local mean free path .\\n.I 1392\\n.T\\nthe solution of small

describes an energy method for\\nthe exact solution of problems concerning the small\\ndisplacements, stability or vibration of a flat rectangular panel\\nwhen the edges are either clamped or simply supported .\\nthe influence of stiffeners which are parallel to one pair of edges,\\nand situated in pairs on opposite sides of the panel\\nso that the neutral axis of each stiffener pair lies in the middle\\nsurface of the panel, is taken into account .  the method\\nis not only applicable to isotropic panels but also to aeolotropic\\npanels when the material of the panel has two directions\\nof elastic symmetry parallel to the edges .\\n  the final solution of the problems depends on an infinite set of\\nlinear equations for small displacement problems or on\\nan infinite determinantal equation for stability and vibration\\nproblems .  the important feature of the analysis given is\\nthat it enables a direct approach to be made to these equations\\nin any particular problem .  it is not in general possible\\nto obtain a direct solution of the final equations and it is\\nnecessary to approximate and consider a finite set of linear\\nequations or a finite determinantal equation derived from the\\nmore important terms in the analytical expression for the\\ntransverse displacement of the panel .  here, physical intuition\\nand, if available, experimental data serve as a guide and\\nthe accuracy of the final results so obtained is gauged by the\\nrate of convergence with the increase in the number of\\nterms considered .\\n  the general method of solution is applied first to the free\\nvibration of a square panel when all the edges are clamped,\\nand second to the buckling of a square panel under shear when\\nthree edges are clamped and one edge is simply supported

for slender\\nsharp-nosed bodies, the heat-transfer coefficients are frequently\\napproximated by using the comparable flat-plate values .\\nhowever, for blunt-nosed bodies, flat-plate solutions are not\\napplicable near the forward stagnation point .  since the greatest rate\\nof heat transfer may occur at the forward stagnation point, its\\nvalue should be investigated .  in this note a theoretical solution\\nis given for the heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of\\na body of revolution assuming laminar, incompressible, low-speed\\nflow .  the comparable solution for two-dimensional flow has\\nbeen given by squire .  in the case of a blunt-nosed body moving\\nwith supersonic velocity, the flow behind the central portion of\\nthe bow wave is subsonic, and it is possible that a low-speed\\nsolution, using as /free-stream/ conditions those behind the center\\nof the bow wave, will apply near the stagnation point .\\n.I 1394\\n.T\\nstagnation point heat
